                  Harbour Project To-Do list

=======================================================================
Tasks for v.1 beta:
-------------------

Assign to: Jean-Francois Lefebvre (JFL)
Detail...: The following need to be added to the OO system:
           Class Method, Multiple Constructor, Class init Support.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: 'SAVE TO' statement doesn't work like Clipper.
Status...: Is it still true?

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Is memofile support complete?
Status...: Is it still true?

***

Assign to: Ryszard, Przemek
Detail...: Debugger with basic interface written in C - it's enough to
           borrow Phil's work from xHarbour.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add missing preprocessor directives from CL5.3:
           REINDEX: missing [NOOPTIMIZE]
           SEEK: missing [LAST]
           SET DESCENDING OFF
           SET DESCENDING ON
           SET SCOPE TO
           SET SCOPETOP TO
           SET SCOPEBOTTOM TO
           SET VIDEOMODE TO
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add missing Clipper virtual memory functions.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: TBrowse() implementation still has bugs.
Status...: Open.


=======================================================================
Tasks for v.1 release:
----------------------

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Rewrite filesys.c to use native platform specific file I/O
           with unlimited number of file handles, while maintaining
           compatibility with the CA-Cl*pper legacy handle numbering
           system. This either involves adding a linked list for the
           translation table, or we should state that only handles 0-4
           are number compatible.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: Optimize out the need for the PUSHNIL opcode before each
           function call.
Status...: Open.


=======================================================================
Tasks for after v.1 release:
----------------------------

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Dynamic multi-language compiler/runtime support.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: UNICODE support.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Multithreading support.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add support for INET sockets.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add support for virtual file handles and registering some
           meta handles so it will be possible to make:
              h := fopen( "gzip:/tmp/myarchive.gz", FO_WRITE )
              fwrite( h, cData )
              fclose( h )
           or:
              h := fopen( "tcp:some.host:port", FO_WRITE )
              ...
           or:
              h := fopen( "|lpr -PLaserJet", FO_WRITE )
              ...
           or:
              h := fopen( "gunzip /tmp/myarchive.gz|", FO_READ )
              ...
           etc.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Define multi platform platform API for GTs which can mix
           graphics objects with standard text output. Now it's
           possible in GTXWC, GTWVT and GTALLEG. This I will discuss
           yet also with xHarbour developers.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add GTNET driver which will allow to run Harbour application
           remotely. GTNET will be used on server side and on client
           side any native GT driver.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add support for remotely controlled GUI objects so we will
           be able to create GUI programs with GTNET.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: <nobody>
Detail...: Add NETRDD - meta RDD which will allow transport layer
           between client application and server application with any
           other chosen RDD driver. Idea similar to GTNET but for RDD
           drivers - it's sth like ADS does.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Extended HB_IT_POINTER. In practice we can give them the
           same functionality as for objects and use them for fast
           creation objects at C level. We can also add HB_VALTYPE()
           function which will return the extended type name, f.e.
           "WINDOW", "FONT", "SOCKET" or anything what 3-rd party
           programmers may want to use. It will greatly simplify
           writing some libraries.
Status...: Open.

                  Harbour Project To-Fix list

=======================================================================

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Eliminate using hb_stackTopItem() it causes that HVM is not
           safe for reentrant and automatic GC activation. To not
           reduce the speed chance the indexes in HB_STACK structure to
           give fastest access to the most last allocated item on the
           stack.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: Clean vertical spacing in .ppo files. It's necessary to
           strep leading blank lines from included files.
Status...: Worjing on it.

***

Assign to: Przemek
Detail...: Fix setting private base for code blocks created by macro
           compiler. Maybe it should be bound with making CLEAR MEMORY
           safe.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: SQLRDD.
Status...: Working on it.

***

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: Hash.
Status...: Working on it.

***

Assign to: Ryszard
Detail...: Real strong typing in the compiler.
Status...: Open.

***

Assign to: ???
Detail...: Remove generation of runtime error inside 'hb_objGetMethod'
           for built-in classes (GET, TBROWSE,...)
Status...: Open.
