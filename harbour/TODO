=======================================================================
Tasks for v.1 release:
_______________________________________________________________________

Rewrite filesys.c to use native platform     ???
specific file I/O with unlimited number 
of file handles, while maintaining 
compatibility with the CA-Cl*pper legacy 
handle numbering system. This either 
involves adding a linked list for the 
translation table, or we should state that 
only handles 0-4 are number compatible.
