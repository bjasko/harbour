                  Harbour Project To-Do list

=======================================================================
Tasks for v.1 beta:
_______________________________________________________________________

          Topic                              Responsible developer(s)
===================================          =========================

TEXT/ENDTEXT support                         ???

DBFCDX support                               Ryszard Glab

Fixing internal HVM/RTL handling of string   ???
items (Clipper passes a pointer to the same
allocated memory instead of creating
string copies)

Remove #pragma pack() tricks                 ???
from rdd .h files.

Rewrite filesys.c to use native platform     ???
specific file I/O with unlimited number 
of file handles, while maintaining 
compatibility with the CA-Cl*pper legacy 
handle numbering system. This either 
involves adding a linked list for the 
translation table, or we should state that 
only handles 0-4 are number compatible. 
[Optimization]

Optimize out the need for the PUSHNIL        Ryszard Glab
opcode before each function call.
[Optimization]

OO system                                    Jean-Francois Lefebvre (JFL)
   Adding Class Method
   Adding Multiple Constructor
   Adding Class init Support

Integrate floating point methods to          ???
avoid inequalities at 13 or more
decimals.  See DETAILS_FLOAT below.

Add missing 5.3 ord* functions.              Brian Hays
OrdKeyVal and others are still in
dummy.prg. Move dbcmd.c

'SAVE TO' statement doesn't work             ???
like clipper's.  Is memofile
support complete?

Dynamic multi-language compiler/runtime      ???

DETAILS_FLOAT
   The building of the double in val.c is simply different than how it
   gets created when coded in source or read from a dbf
   See Harbour archives under the subject
      Some numbers are not as equal as others
