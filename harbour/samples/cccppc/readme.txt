cccppc
------

This is a CA-Clipper 5.x compatible preprocessor written in
Clipper.

The development of this program has been continued in C++, so
this Clipper version is discontinued and only serves testing
and demonstration purposes.

Use "rmake makefile.rmk" to build it in CA-Cl*pper.

Notes from the uploader [vszel]:

These files were originally located in a separate subdirectory
named "object", they were moved to the main directory so that
the GNU-make can be used to build it:

   /object
   behavior.cls
   behavior.och
   meta.cls
   meta.och
   metaclas.cls
   metaclas.och
   object.cls
   object.och
   object.prg
   objgen.ch
   package.cls
   package.och
   package.prg
   version.prg

Some files (*.OCH) don't have CVS headers, since
they were automatically generated by an external utility.
