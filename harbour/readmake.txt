This makefile tree provides an easy method to build 
the entire Harbour project.  The development environment 
was Cygnus win32 B19 developers distribution, which 
means GNU Make and GCC.  The root makefile will build
the Harbour compiler, the VM, the RTL, and all tests found
in the TESTS/WORKING dir.  There is also a MAKEFILE.GCC in
TESTS/BROKEN, but it is not called by the root makefile.

I have left all the MAKEFILE names as MAKEFILE.GCC.

Using the makefiles for development:  Say you've just written
a new RTL function in C.  Just type 
	make -f MAKEFILE.GCC
in the RTL directory and it will compile it for you, and if
the compile succeeds, add it to libharbour.a.

Say you've just written a new test function in Harbour, in the
TESTS directory.  Just type
	make -f MAKEFILE.GCC
and it will harbour it, gcc it, and link it (along with any other
uncompiled tests) into an EXE file.

Say you just want to work with one Harbour test called FOO.PRG.
Do this:
	make -f MAKEFILE.GCC foo.exe


Because of how my system unpacks a build, I assumed that all
of the original files have uppercase filenames.  Therefore
I put in workarounds for .C instead of .c, .PRG instead of .prg,
etc.  Hopefully this won't cause much trouble if you happen to
change all filenames to lowercase on your system.
