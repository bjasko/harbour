/*
 * Notes from the fringe... <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
 *
 * Clipper is a bit schizoid with the treatment of file attributes, but we've
 * emulated that weirdness here for your viewing amusement.
 *
 * In Clippers' homeworld of DOS, there are 5 basic attributes: 'A'rchive,
 * 'H'idden, 'S'ystem, 'R'eadonly and 'D'irectory.  In addition, a file can
 * have no attributes, and only 1 file per physical partition can have the
 * 'V'olume label.
 *
 * For a given file request, it is implied that the attribute mask includes
 * all attributes except 'H'idden, 'S'ystem, 'D'irectory and 'V'olume.
 * The returned file list will always include (for instance) 'R'eadOnly files
 * unless they also happen to be 'H'idden and that attribute was not requested.
 *
 * "V" is a special case - you will get back the entry that describes the
 * volume label for the drive implied by the filemask.
 *
 * Differences from the 'standard' (where supported):
 * - Filenames will be returned in the same case as they are stored in the
 *   directory.  Clipper (and VO too) will convert the names to upper case
 * - Filenames will be the full filename as supported by the OS in use.
 * - There are a number of additional file attributes returned.
 *   They are:
 *       'I' - DEVICE      File is a device
 *       'T' - TEMPORARY   File is a Temporary file
 *       'P' - SPARSE      File is Sparse
 *       'L' - REPARSE     File/Dir is a reparse point
 *       'C' - COMPRESSED  File/Dir is compressed
 *       'O' - OFFLINE     File/Dir is not online
 *       'X' - NOTINDEXED  Exclude File/Dir from Indexing Service
 *       'E' - ENCRYPTED   File/Dir is Encrypted
 *       'M' - VOLCOMP     Volume Supports Compression
 * - Clipper can sometimes drop the ReadOnly indication of directories.
 *   Harbour detects this correctly.
 *
 * TODO: - Under an MS Windows implimentation, an optional 3rd parameter to
 *         Directory to allow you to receive the compatible '8.3' filename.
 *       - check that path support vis stat works on all platforms
 *       - UNC Support? ie: dir \\myserver\root
 *
 * TOFIX:- Volume label support
