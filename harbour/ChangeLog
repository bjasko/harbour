    include/directry.ch
    ! printf()s commented out, proper (but silent) error handling added.
    + Now using directry.ch for the array format.
    + A TODO: added about changing the file composing/decomposing functionality

19990915-11:15 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/dir.c
    ! Two warnings fixed about possibly missing paranthesis.
    + Reformatted.
  * source/rtl/adir.prg
    ! Default flags reset to "HSD"
  * tests/working/adirtest.prg
    ! Fixed a bug which caused an error when zero files was found.
    + Added: SET DATE ANSI, SET CENTURY ON
    ! Newline handling made platform compatible.
    ! Some other fixes.
  * source/rtl/memvars.c
    ! Typos fixed.

19990915-03:40 EDT Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
  * source/rtl/dir.c
    * Now Clipper compatible results are returned.
      definately with MSVC - most likely with compilers running under MS OS.
      since I'm not familliar with any quirks with those compilers I made
      almost no changes to compiler specific code.  I suspect though that
      there may be problems when passing a full path with wildcard to
      Directory() - please test.
    + You can now get the 8.3 filename (msvc again) for true Clipper
      compatibible return results by passing a logical as the new 3rd
      parameter. The default is .f. which gives full long filenames
    + Add a number of static funcs like HarbourMaskToAttributes() to
      convert "DHS" to something the os understands.
    ! Where this all falls apart is for OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE.
      I don't know what to do about translating Hidden or System files.
      and not too sure how to handle Readonly.
      Nobody commented when I posted the code - so here is what I came up
      with.
  * tests/working/dirtest.prg
    + added 3rd parameter to indicate 'want 8.3 filenames'
  
19990915-03:20 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/do.c
    - Previous fix undone, since it was causing other problems.

19990915-02:20 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * .cvspass
    - File removed, since it was probably added by incident.

19990915-01:22 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/compiler/gen*.c
    + some fflush() calls added to see a better feedback about the progress
      of the generation process.

19990915-00:38 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * tests/working/sound.prg
    tests/working/*.bat
    tests/working/*.ch
    + CVS header added to all files.
    + @echo off added where missing.

19990915-00:30 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * (*.* in the root directory)
    + CVS header added to all files.
    + @echo off added where missing.
  * build32.bat
    build40.bat
    build31.bat
    build.bat (renamed)
    build16.bat (new)
    buildrdd.bat (removed)
    bldgt32.bat (removed)
    bldhbpp.bat (removed)
    % These three batch files has been incorporated to the main build
      batch files, since they were simple one-liners.
    ! hbpplib.b32 build process was executed two times from the build32.bat
      and build40.bat files.
    * build.bat renamed to build16.bat

19990914-17:30 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * config/rules.cf
    * Harbour flag /q changed to /q0 to omit the compiler header.
  * source/rtl/do.c
    ! DO() fixed to use hb_dynsymFind() instead of hb_dynsymGet(), 
      now it properly displays when the passed string is not a symbol, rather
      then throwing an internal error.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    + /CREDITS command line switch to display the development team. Like in 
      Clipper.

19990914-13:15 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    source/compiler/gen*.c
    + Help screen made more Clipper like.
    + /f switch changed to /gf, and the whole object generation build
      in to the source in a more standard way. It works now.
    + /q0 switch added to the help screen.
    + All filename composing stuff related to specific output types moved to 
      the appropriate gen*.c file. This way the code is more modular.
    ! One variable made static in genobj32.c

19990914-11:40 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/runner/stdalone/external.prg
    include/external.ch
    * Regenerated.
  * source/runner/runlib.c
    ! Made some steps to release memory blocks when an undeclared symbol error 
      occurs, seemingly with few success. This needs some more work.
    + TODO added about a possible direction for further development.
      The idea would be to replicate the Blinker DLL functionality.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    source/compiler/harbour.l
    source/compiler/gen*.c
    * Only every 100th line number is shown on the counter while parsing,
      this way it's more Clipper like. In theory it should also be faster,
      but due to the stdout buffering, it's approx. the same speed. Though it 
      could be faster in some platform/compiler/screen output combinations.
    + The "syntax ok" message is now replaced with the total number of 
      functions and the total number of lines. Similar to Clipper, but not
      so specific to the generated output.
    + /q0 switch no suppresses the "Harbour Compiler" header.
    + The "Generating ... output" line format changed, it's now more
      compact.
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    + A new VAL() test added to test the huge value problem.
    ! One failure eliminated by hiding a filename generating difference in
      __COPYFILE(), NOTE added about this.
  * source/rtl/strings.c
    + HB_VAL() now uses hb_retnlen().
    ! HB_VAL() was incompatible for huge integer values (5000000000). This
      is fixed.
  * source/rtl/memvars.c
    * __MVRESTORE() is now using hb_itemPutNLen()
  * source/rtl/extend.c
    include/extend.h
    + hb_retnlen() Extend API function added, which is a wrapper for
      hb_itemPutNLen().
  * source/rtl/itemapi.c
    include/itemapi.h
    + hb_itemPutNLen() generic function added to assign a number to an item, 
      the low-level type of the number is automatically selected, based on the
      magnitude and presence of decimal places. Similar to hb_vmPushNumber().
    + hb_itemPutN?Len() functions will now accept any negative width/dec
      parameters as a request for the default. So:
      For iDec now any negative number will do the same as -1 before.
      For iWidth now any negative number will do the same as 0 before.
      This way the interface is more fool proof and consistent.

19990914-01:00 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    include/ctoharb.h
    + hb_vmEqual() - Added support for alternate equal operator: "="
      Currently they are exact synonyms.
    + hb_vmInc()/hb_vmDec() - "++", "--" operator overloading support added.
    + hb_stackDispLocal() - More values are printed, the format changed.
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    tests/working/overload.prg
    ! The tests fixed again, "+="/"-=" operators removed from the class 
      declaration.
    * "+"/"-" implementation changed to not modify the original value, since
      the expression "oString + 'A'" in itself in one line is not valid anyway.
    + "++", "--" operator overloading added.
    - Removed the "<>" and "#" overloading methods since they were not needed
      in this case.

19990913-23:45 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + hb_vmInString() - Added support for overloading the "$" operator.
    ! hb_vmPlus() - Fixed the operator overloading feature.
    + hb_vmNotEqual() - Added support for alternate notequal operators: 
      "<>" and "#".
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    tests/working/overload.prg
    - Removed +=, -= tests, since they will destroy the object, basically
      this gets executed: oString := oString + "Hello", where the right side
      expression will result in a string, which gets assigned to the object.
      This could be fixed by changing the overloader block to return self BTW,
      but from the test point of view, this is the same as "+"/"-".
