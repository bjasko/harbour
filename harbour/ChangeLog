    Some clean up
  * tests/broken/runner.c | run_exp.h | stub.bat
    removed

    added runner code
  * tests/working/spawn.prg
    spawn example program
  * tests/working/readhrb.prg + readhrb.lnk
    Clipper program to read .HRB files

19990518-23:15 David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * makefile.b31
    - Put all common BCC options in c_opt macro to make it easy to switch to
      C++ by simply adding -P to c_opt and changing -P- on fixflex line to -P+
    - I left the makefile creating Harbour using C, because there was no change
      in harbour.exe size or behaviour with C++ (Borland C++ 3.1)
  * source/compiler/fixflex.c
    - Modified to work with both C and C++ versions of Harbour
  + tests/working/bldpexe.bat
    - Copy of buildexe.bat with -P option to compile with C++
  + tests/working/hbp.bat
    - Copy of hb.bat that calls bldpexe.bat to use C++

19990519-02:45 Ryszard Glab <rglab@imid.med.pl>

* source/compiler/harbour.y
    - added support for INCLUDE environment variable
    - corrected looking for unmatched ENDIF/ELSE//ELSEIF
    - added '-t' option = alternative initialization of symbol table
    When this option is used then the Harbour generates C code for a function
    <modulename>__InitSymbols that have to be called in order to properly
    initialize the global symbol table. You should use this option if you
    want to generate the C code output and your C compiler doesn't allow 
    to call any function before the 'main'.

* surce/vm/initsymb.c
    - added new file that registers a symbols table with runtime support 
    functions. This file can be edited to add calls for application specific 
    functions that registers local symbols tables used in application modules.
    The Harbour compiler can create <modulename>__InitSymbols functions 
    when you use '-t' option.

* source/vm/hvm.c
    - added call for InitSymbolTable function that registers symbol table
    with runtime support Harbour functions.

      value is truncated, wLength is set to 10, and wDec is set to 0.
  * tests/working/dates.prg
    - Removed trailing spaces in strings in OUTSDT calls with multiple items,
      because OUTSTD provides a leading space for all items but the first.
  * tests/working/mathtest.prg
    - Added QOUT(454.14) and QOUT(INT(454)) to debug INT problem with
      Borland C++ 3.1, which lead to change to INT in source/rtl/math.c

      result of the assignment.

19990507-23:45 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  This update makes Harbour compatible with the IBM C++ compiler.
  * include/init.h
    - Added test for IBM C++ compiler to Microsoft C #if block
  * include/types.h
    - Added #ifdef block for IBM C++ compiler to set #define for
      HARBOUR as simply void and also to set up a new #define
      for EXTERNAL_LINKAGE (as _LNK_CONV) in order for the
      IBM C++ compiler to compile harbour.y.
  * source/compiler/harbour.l
    - Added static to forward delcaration for yyunput in order to
      match the actual definition.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    - Added static to forward declaration of __yy_memcpy in order
      to match the actual definition.
    - Added EXTERNAL_LINKAGE to sz_compare4 definition, so
      that the IBM C++ compiler can successfully compile Harbour.
    - Added (BYTE *) type override to szText parameter in second
      invocation of GenPCodeN (the first one already had an override).

19990507-23:15 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    - Changed byte by byte copy used in PushString to memcpy,
      because the side effects of code like szTemp[w++] = szText[w]
      is compiler dependent. Borland C++ 3.1 (in C mode) copies byte
      0 to byte 0, etc., but IBM Visual Age C++ 3.0 (in C++ mode)
      copies byte 1 to byte 0, etc.

    * source/compiler/harbour.y, source/compiler/harbour.l
        -static variables can be accessed in a codeblock even if this
         codeblock is a return value (detached static variables)
        -Harbour finds now illegal initializations of static variables
         (static variables can be initialized using literals only)

         of compiled source code is the same as reserved function
        -corrected support for /*******/ comments
        -Harbour distinguish now 'CASE' variable, 'CASE()' function and
         CASE statement (see tests/working/keywords.prg)

          hb_strempty() speed optimalization, cleanup.

        * source/rtl/Makefile:
        By mistake, we were not compiling the PRG files into OBJS for the
        rtl library.

        * source/rtl/dates.c:
        Changed the use of min with explicit code. min and max are macros
        in some platforms, functions in others, and it is usually a mess
        to link against them.

        * source/Makefile:
        * source/tools/Makefile:
        This directory was not being compiled.

        * source/tools/genobj.c:
        Got rid of most (all?) the warnings.

        * tests/working/Makefile:
        Now the libs to link against are explicitly specified in the
        Makefile.

        * tests/working/statics.prg:
        Cleaned up all ^M characters.

Thu May 06 12:34:45 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * source/compiler/harbour.l:
        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        * source/rtl/set.c:
        Again, I renamed _AND and _OR to AND_ and OR_, and cleaned up a
        few warnings.

Wed May 05 18:51:06 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * source/rtl/transfrm.c:
        * source/vm/dynsym.c:
        Replaced C++-style comments (//) with C-style commens (/* */).

        * makefile.b16:
        * makefile.b32:
        Added explicit rules to compile harbour.o from harbour.c.
        Don' know why these were necessary, but it seems people had
        problems without them.

Wed May 05 16:29:19 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * include/pcode.h:
        * source/vm/hvm.c:
        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        Replaced _AND and _OR with AND_ and OR_.
        Under gcc, these two identifiers are defined out.
        Also, got rid of a few warnings.

        * source/rtl/files.c:
        Implemented a macro trick to allow compilation of
        FOPEN, FREAD and FWRITE.
        Turned off HAVE_POSIX_IO for gcc; it doesn't seem to work.
        Restructured the code so that when HAVE_POSIX_IO is not defined,
        there are no warnings.

Wed May 05 15:30:49 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * source/harbour.y:
        * source/compiler/harbour.c:
        Replaced main() with harbour_main(), and added a separate
        harbour.c with just the main() function.

        * makefile.b16:
        * makefile.b32:
        * makefile.vc:
        Updated these files to reflect the new source/compiler/harbour.c
        file.

        * .cvsignore:
        Added this file with the patterns CVS will ignore while
        processing.

        * include/Set.ch:
        * tests/working/block2.PRG:
        Added back these files. They can't be renamed through CVS on NT,
        and the repository will have to be updated by some other means.

Wed May 05 09:19:23 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * include/Set.ch:
        * tests/working/block2.PRG:
        Removed these files in preparation to move them to lowercase.

        Added this file.
   * source/pp/pragma.c
   * contrib/dot/pp_harb.ch
   * tests/inline_c.prg
