   + doc/howtomak.txt
     + Enhanced the CVS upload guide.
     + Added guide how to make Harbour binary from the source.

   * makefile.*

       Thanks to Matteo Baccan for this contribution.
     ; !! WARNING !! I could not test this since I don't have the java
       tools needed.

   * makefile.vc
   * make_vc.bat
     - The JAVA runtime generation feature removed. (see previous entry)

   * source/vm/debug.c
     * One static function renamed.

   * include/clipdefs.h
     ! pascal keyword removed from here, too. So the rule has changed that
       all mixed or lower case CLIPPER function names must be converted to
       uppercase to make it work with Harbour.

20000326-16:58 EST Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
   * source/rtl/gtwin/gtwin.c
     * further refinement on screen sizing.  Size is now restored on exit.

   * makefile.bc
     ! Fixed.
   * ChangeLog.006
     ! Corrected the case. (Temporarily removed, until someone at

20000326-03:42 EST Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
   * source/rtl/gtwin/gtwin.c
     * This is an old problem:
       Because Windows allows you to set the size of the window to something
       like 100x300 (for example) you then get scroll bars on the window.
       I've been toying with the various conditions and oddities that might
       arise from this situation.  This includes switching from a window
       to full screen where the max visible is typically 50x80, yet the system
       can still give you access to the full 100x300.  Writing to the extra
       screen space is simple enough, but using it becomes annoying, since
       the system will move the buffer around to keep the cursor in view.
       Rather than fight it, gt_init, now caps the screen size to 50x80.
       If you want a bigger size, then it is assumed you know what you are
       going to do with the extra real eastate, and thus you can call
       SetMode(100,300).

20000326-08:06 GMT+1 Victor Szakats <info@szelvesz.hu>

   * include/hbdefs.h
   * include/clipdefs.h
     * Now the HARBOUR keyword requires the function name to be in uppercase.
       The compatibility CLIPPER keyword still allows for mixed case function
       names on some platforms. The reason is that "pascal" keyword is
       non-portable, and the above requirement was already there for some
       platforms, now it's a generic rule.
     - Removed the __attribute__ ((stdcall)) for the __GNUC__ branch. Setting
       any specific calling convention is not needed, since we don't need to
       deal with compatibility with precompiled legacy libs, there's no
       such thing, CA-Cl*pper never supported GNU C.
     ; Now the HARBOUR macro is quite simple, it's plain "void".

   * source/pp/ppcore.c
     + Added predefined macro __HB_MAIN__. The macro is undefined or holds the
       value of HARBOUR_START_PROCEDURE depending on the compiler.
       Use this code to make your Harbour startup procedure platform/compiler
       independent:
       #ifndef __HB_MAIN__
          #define __HB_MAIN__ AppMain /* Or whatever you wish to call it */
       #endif
       FUNCTION __HB_MAIN__()

   + contrib/hbclip/hbclip.h
     + Added header file which can be used to maintain common C source code
       for CA-Cl*pper and Harbour. The legacy code needs a one-time conversion
       to make this work.

   * source/rtl/dir.c

   - make_tpl.*

   + make_gnu.*
   + bin/bld.*
     + GNU-make starters renamed to better show their purpose.
     + GNU-make starters modified to work like bld_gnu.*, so that they don't
       need to be modified, instead they expect the HB_ envvars to be set. Now
       they also throw a help screen when something is not set.
     + BLD.SH bash script added to build Harbour executables.
     + Other small improvements.

   * source/rtl/console.c
     % DISPOUT(), DISPOUTAT(), DEVOUT() optimized
     % DISPOUTAT() made even more CA-Cl*pper compatible.
     ! SETPRC() made even more CA-Cl*pper compatible.
     * Some variables renamed.
