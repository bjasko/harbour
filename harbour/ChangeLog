    ! fixed Harbour support for accessing string characters with array
      index operators []
    + added support for #define HB_COMPAT_XHB - it's disabled by default.
      When set it enables some of xHarbour features like negative array
      indexes calculated from tail, accessing string characters with []
      operators (warning it's not compatible with default Harbour version
      enabled by -ks during compilation and //flags:s at runtime - in
      xHarbour compatibility mode "ABC"[2] returns "B" when in Harbour 66)
      and some other minor features.

  * harbour/source/compiler/cmdcheck.c
    * added support for optional setting C output type in -go switch
      Now it accepts optional digit [0123] after -go in the same way
      as -gc, f.e.: -go3

  * harbour/source/compiler/harbour.c
    * call hb_compExprLstDealloc() only when errors appeared during
      compilation - it disable automatic freeing all allocated expressions
      in clean compilation. I make it intentionally for easier detecting
      problems one some expressions are not freed. So far the final cleanup
      code always deallocated expressions what can hide some real bugs.

  * harbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    ! fixed very serious bug in HVM closing. The s_uiActionRequest flag
      was not cleared before hb_rddShutDown() so when RDD buffers were
      hot and flushing required some PCODE evaluation (f.e. index KEY
      or FOR expression) then they were not properly evaluated.

  * harbour/source/vm/macro.c
    * minor improvement

  * harbour/utils/hbtest/rt_misc.prg
    ! fixed one of expected result, it was neither Harbour nor Clipper
      result (I've just made some test with Clipper), I do not know why
      it existed

  * harbour/source/macro/macro.y
    * formatting

  * harbour/source/vm/macro.c
    ! fixed macrocompiler for proper compilation of string with embedded
      ASCII NUL byte (chr(0)), f.e.:
         ? &("'["+chr(0)+"]'")

  * harbour/contrib/rdd_ads/adsfunc.c
  * harbour/source/rdd/workarea.c
    * formatting

  * harbour/include/hbapi.h
  * harbour/source/vm/extend.c
    + added missing hb_storptrGC()

  * harbour/include/hbapicdp.h
  * harbour/source/rtl/cdpapi.c
    + added parameter to unicode translation function to protect control
      code translation
    * formatting

  * harbour/source/rtl/gtsln/kbsln.c
  * harbour/source/rtl/gtxwc/gtxwc.c
    * use new unicode translation function format. It also fixes problem
      with space translation in GTLSN used in UTF8 mode

  * harbour/include/hbapiitm.h
  * harbour/source/vm/itemapi.c
    + added hb_itemCopyToRef(), hb_itemMoveToRef(), hb_itemMoveRef(),
      hb_itemUnRefWrite()

  * harbour/include/hbexprb.c
    ! use HB_P_DUPLUNREF instead of HB_P_DUPLICATE when assign is used in
      push context - Clipper compatible behavior, see:
         x:=10
         f(y:=iif(.t.,@x,))
         ? x, y
         func f(x)
         x+=100
         return nil

  * harbour/include/hbver.h
  * harbour/source/common/hbver.c
    * changed status to "devel"

  * harbour/source/common/expropt2.c
    * disabled setting NIL when iif(.t.,,sth()) is optimized to avoid
      warning when iif() is used as statement - to fix number of parameters
      passed to function in code like f(iif(.t.,,sth())) we will need a
      little bit deeper modification

  * harbour/source/compiler/complex.c
    * added hack for potential problems caused by WITH OBJECT syntax, f.e.
      in code like:
         proc p(obj,x)
         case:=myCaseClass():new()
         retu:=myCaseClass():new()
         WITH OBJECT obj
            do case
               case x==nil
               case:value()
               case:action()
                  retu:sth()
            end
         END
         case:action()
         retu:sth()
         return
      case:action(), case:value(), retu:sth() can means two different things
      and compiler cannot guess which one should use. It cannot be fixed
      because it's caused by bad WITH OBJECT syntax. In xHarbour constractions
      like case:value() or retu:sth() are always used as in  WITH OBJECT
      context what is not Clipper compatible. I do not want to introduce
      such limitations. We have two choices: change WITH OBJECT syntax or
      add some hack to "hide" the problem a little bit. Now I intorduce
      ugly hack which check number of spaces between ':' so
         case :action()
      is compiled as case condition using WITH OBJECT message and
      case:action() as sending message to object in case variable

  * harbour/source/compiler/harbour.y
  * harbour/source/compiler/harbour.yyc
    + added support for passing base value to FOR EACH by reference.
  
  * harbour/source/vm/arrays.c
    * use hb_itemMoveRef() in AINS()/ADEL() to avoid creation of cyclic
      reference chains

  * harbour/source/vm/debug.c
  * harbour/source/vm/memvars.c
    * use hb_itemCopyToRef() to avoid creation of cyclic reference chains

  * harbour/source/vm/classes.c
  * harbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    * use hb_itemMoveToRef() to avoid creation of cyclic reference chains
    + added support for for writable string enumerators, f.e.:
         proc main()
         local s, c
         s:="abcdefghijklmnopqrst"
         for each c in @s
            if c$"aeio"
               c:="*"
            endif
         next
         ? s // "*bcd*fgh*jklmn*pqrst"
         return
