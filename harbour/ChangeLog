  * include/extend.h
    - Moved "#include <limits.h>" to include/types.h
    - Removed "#define FILE" and "#undef FILE", which are no longer
      needed, because HARBOUR FILE() was renamed to HARBOUR HB_FILE()
      some time ago.
  * include/types.h
    - Moved "#include <limits.h>" from include/extend.h in order to
      avoid having to require that extend.h be included before set.h
  * source/rtl/dates.c
    - HARBOUR SECONDS() and support module hb_seconds() courtesy of
      Jose Lalin <dezac@corevia.com>. I removed the use of clock()
      from hb_time(), because clock() returns the number of clock
      ticks since the program started, which has no relationship to
      when the seconds of the real time clock roll over. This means
      that SECONDS() will always return whole seconds instead of
      seconds and hundredths. I also provided an alternate hb_seconds
      implementation for DOS platforms using gettime() instead of
      time() and localtime(), because gettime() includes 1/100ths.
  * source/rtl/files.c
    - Don't "#include <mingw32/share.h>" if compiling with DJGPP.
  + tests/working/seconds.prg
    - New test program for SECONDS().

    With _GetClassName(); optimized; more comments; more clean-up

19990603-21:50 CET Eddie Runia
  * source/rtl/classes.c; tests/working/run_exp.h
    OBJFUNC.PRG added to init symbols scheme.

19990603-20:20 CET Eddie Runia

    First implementation of init symbols scheme.

19990603-14:00 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * makefile.dos
    - Even with the -y in the source/compiler/makefile.dos, when I
      used builddos, which uses makefile.dos, instead of a temporary
      replacement batch file that I used before I figured out why I
      was getting bad command errors when running builddos (it turned
      out that I needed to add the DJGPP\bin directory to the path in
      C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT), it moved y_tab.c to harbour.c!
      So I converted everything in makefile.dos from upper case to
      lower case and it stopped doing that. So i also added the missing
      source/tools directory, so that everything gets build.
  * source/compiler/harbour.l
    - Changed yylval.string = ')'; to yylval.string = strdup( ")" );
    - Changed yylval.string = ']'; to yylval.string = strdup( "]" );

19990603-13:30 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  Thanks go to Jose Lalin <dezac@corevia.com>
  * source/rtl/dates.c
    - localtime() returns tm_year with 1900 already subtracted from it,
      so it is necessary to add 1900 back when formatting the date.

19990603-18:30 CET Eddie Runia
  * source/rtl/classes.c; source/rtl/tclass.prg; source/rtl/arrays.c
  * include/ctoharb.h; include/extend.h
    New class module added with lots of commands and alphabetic order.
    aClone() no longer necessary for super casting
    ctoharb.h updated so the forward declarations could be removed.

19990603-16:00 CET Eddie Runia
  * source/rtl/classes.c
    wLimit bug resolved

19990603-15:25 CET Eddie Runia

19990603-00:30 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * makedos.env
    - Removed HARBOURDIR definition to a batch file

19990602-23:30 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/compiler/makefile.dos
    - bison needs -y option so that it won't replace harbour.c with y_tab.c
      when building Harbour with DJGPP
  * source/rtl/console.c
    - Moved MAXROW() and MAXCOL() from gtapi.c and added #ifdef USE_GTAPI
      in each. The #else condition defines the screen as 24x80 (23, 79)
  * source/rtl/gtapi.c
    - Moved MAXROW() and MAXCOL() to console.c in order to not include the
      GT API when it isn't wanted (such as when building with DJGPP)

19990602-20:45 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/rtl/environ.c

19990602-16:00 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  + tests/broken/codebloc.prg
    - Output doesn't match Clipper. Clipper outputs NIL and 42,
      (both 5.2e and 5.3b), but Harbour outputs NIL and NIL (as
      tested with Harbour built using Borland C++ 3.1 using the
      build31.bat and makefile.b31 files)

19990602-22:10 CET Eddie Runia

    gtApi and new console functions added

19990602-16:00 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/rtl/console.c
    - OS/2 requires that stdout and stderr be flushed in order to stay
      synchronized with the GT API
  * source/rtl/gt/gtos2.c
     - The gtPuts function was using strlen() on the text buffer instead
       of using the text length parameter

19990602-14:50 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

      rule that Harbour functions may not use any lower case letters
    - Added end comment for comment block around color tests in order
      to avoid having nested comments
  * source/tools/chareven.c
    - Added (char *) type conversion to _xgrab() function call

    - The GT API and dev_row, dev_col synchronization now also includes
      OUTSTD() and OUTERR().
  * source/rtl/gtapi.c
    - Corrected error in column overflow handling in _gtWrite()

19990602-18:40 CET Eddie Runia

    - _gtMaxCol() and _gtMaxRow() are 0-based in Clipper, so subtract 1
      from the device width and height
    - Removed call to strlen() in _gtSave(), because Clipper does not appear
      to require the screen buffer to be initialized, just allocated
    - Changed _gtWrite() to deal with writing multiple rows of text
    - Wrote _gtScroll(), which is needed by _gtWritePos() and _gtWrite().

        * source/rtl/dates.c:
        Nasty bug: using '&' instead of '&&'.

        * config/header.cf:
        * include/Makefile:
        * Makefile:
        Added rules to deal with include files (they are just installed
        into INC_DIR). Now the top level Makefile traverses include before
        source.

        * config/win32/gcc.cf:
        * config/win32/msvc.cf:
        * config/win32/global.cf:
        The include directory is now given by INC_DIR.

        * config/win32/rules.cf:
        Harbour now uses -I to find include files.

        * include/hbsetup.h:
        Moved OS_PATH_DELIMITER back to harbour.y, as PATH_DELIMITER; it
        is now a string that contains "/\\".

        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        Deal with '/' as path separator ('\\' still works).
        Make sure -q is really quiet.

        * source/rtl/Makefile:
        * source/tools/Makefile:
        Used tabs instead of spaces.

        * source/rtl/gtapi.c:
        * source/tools/io.c:
        Made sure these two compile in non-DOS platforms (don't do much
        though).

        * source/vm/hvm.c:
        Fixed a warning about using %i instead of %li.

19990520-07:10 MST Bil Simser (bsimser@home.com)
  * makefile.vc
    Updated makefile to include new changes to RTL

19990520-13:50 CET Eddie Runia

  * source/rtl/strings.c
    - Added test for hb_set_fixed and set default number of decimal positions
      to hb_set.HB_SET_DECIMALS if hb_set_fixed is TRUE instead of using the
      number of decimal positions specified in the ITEM structure.
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    - Removed the special case for a return value of zero from PushNumber().
  * tests/working/teststr.prg
    - Added a second run of the test with SET FIXED ON.

19990519-23:50 EST David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/rtl/extend.c
    - Use wDec = hb_set.HB_SET_DECIMALS instead of wDec = 2.
    - _retnd() and _stornd() now set wLength to 20 if the value is over 10 digits.
  * source/rtl/itemapi.c
    - Use wDec = hb_set.HB_SET_DECIMALS instead of wDec = 2.
    - hb_itemPutND() now sets wLength to 20 if the value is over 10 digits.
  * source/rtl/math.c
    - Restored HARBOUR INT() back to use _retnl( _parnd( 1 ) ), because the
      problem was not in the Borland C++ 3.1 compiler, but in the hb_outstd()
      case for IT_LONG in console.c (see 19990518-17:30 EDT David G. Holm for
      the incorrect correction and 19990519-21:40 EST David G. Holm for the
      fix to hb_outstd() in console.c).
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    - Div(), Modulus(), and Power() set wDec to hb_set.HB_SET_DECIMALS.
    - Dec(), Inc(), FOR, and Negate() leave wDec unchanged.

19990519-21:40 EST David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * makefile.b31
    - Modified to support changes to source/compiler/fixflex.c
  * source/compiler/fixflex.c
    - The two largest tables in lexyy.c are now larger than 64K combined,
      so they are now placed into separate source files and the four next
      largest tables are split into a third source file.
  * source/rtl/console.c
    - Corrected display of IT_LONG to use value.lNumber instead of iNumber.
    - Corrected display of IT_DOUBLE to use wLength as integer size, so that
      when printing decimals the total display size is wLength + wDec + 1.
  * source/rtl/extend.c
    - _retnd and _stornd now set wLength to 10 instead of 13.
  * source/rtl/itemapi.c
    - hb_itemPutL now sets wLength to 3.

    Clipper program to read .HRB files

19990518-23:15 David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * makefile.b31
    - Put all common BCC options in c_opt macro to make it easy to switch to
      C++ by simply adding -P to c_opt and changing -P- on fixflex line to -P+
    - I left the makefile creating Harbour using C, because there was no change
      in harbour.exe size or behaviour with C++ (Borland C++ 3.1)

* source/compiler/harbour.y
    - added support for INCLUDE environment variable
    - corrected looking for unmatched ENDIF/ELSE//ELSEIF
    - added '-t' option = alternative initialization of symbol table
    When this option is used then the Harbour generates C code for a function
    <modulename>__InitSymbols that have to be called in order to properly
    initialize the global symbol table. You should use this option if you
    want to generate the C code output and your C compiler doesn't allow
    to call any function before the 'main'.

* surce/vm/initsymb.c
    - added new file that registers a symbols table with runtime support
    functions. This file can be edited to add calls for application specific
    functions that registers local symbols tables used in application modules.
    The Harbour compiler can create <modulename>__InitSymbols functions
    when you use '-t' option.

* source/vm/hvm.c
    - added call for InitSymbolTable function that registers symbol table
    with runtime support Harbour functions.

    - Set stack.Return.wLength and stack.Return.wDec for numbers.
    - _retds() now returns 8 spaces for invalid dates.
  * source/rtl/math.c
    - ABS returns same numeric type as parameter.
    - INT returns same numeric type as parameter, but for IT_DOUBLE, the
      value is truncated, wLength is set to 10, and wDec is set to 0.
  * tests/working/dates.prg
    - Removed trailing spaces in strings in OUTSDT calls with multiple items,
      because OUTSTD provides a leading space for all items but the first.
  * tests/working/mathtest.prg
    - Added QOUT(454.14) and QOUT(INT(454)) to debug INT problem with
      Borland C++ 3.1, which lead to change to INT in source/rtl/math.c

      to have the (YY_BUFFER_STATE) type override apply to the
      result of the assignment.

19990507-23:45 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  This update makes Harbour compatible with the IBM C++ compiler.
  * include/init.h
    - Added test for IBM C++ compiler to Microsoft C #if block
  * include/types.h
    - Added #ifdef block for IBM C++ compiler to set #define for
      HARBOUR as simply void and also to set up a new #define
      for EXTERNAL_LINKAGE (as _LNK_CONV) in order for the
      IBM C++ compiler to compile harbour.y.
  * source/compiler/harbour.l
    - Added static to forward delcaration for yyunput in order to
      match the actual definition.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    - Added static to forward declaration of __yy_memcpy in order
      to match the actual definition.
    - Added EXTERNAL_LINKAGE to sz_compare4 definition, so
      that the IBM C++ compiler can successfully compile Harbour.
    - Added (BYTE *) type override to szText parameter in second
      invocation of GenPCodeN (the first one already had an override).

19990507-23:15 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    - Changed byte by byte copy used in PushString to memcpy,
      because the side effects of code like szTemp[w++] = szText[w]
      is compiler dependent. Borland C++ 3.1 (in C mode) copies byte
      0 to byte 0, etc., but IBM Visual Age C++ 3.0 (in C++ mode)
      copies byte 1 to byte 0, etc.

Sat May  8 03:02:04 1999 Ryszard Glab <rglab@imid.med.pl>

    * source/compiler/harbour.y, source/compiler/harbour.l
        -static variables can be accessed in a codeblock even if this
         codeblock is a return value (detached static variables)
        -Harbour finds now illegal initializations of static variables
         (static variables can be initialized using literals only)
        -there is no 'redefinition of predefined function' error when the name
         of compiled source code is the same as reserved function
        -corrected support for /*******/ comments
        -Harbour distinguish now 'CASE' variable, 'CASE()' function and
         CASE statement (see tests/working/keywords.prg)

    * tests/working/keywords.prg
        -added many more wild statements to test Harbour compiler

    * test/working/statics.prg

        rtl library.

        * source/rtl/dates.c:
        Changed the use of min with explicit code. min and max are macros
        in some platforms, functions in others, and it is usually a mess
        to link against them.

        * source/Makefile:
        * source/tools/Makefile:
        This directory was not being compiled.

        * source/tools/genobj.c:

        * makefile.b16:
        * makefile.b32:
        Added explicit rules to compile harbour.o from harbour.c.
        Don' know why these were necessary, but it seems people had
        problems without them.

Wed May 05 16:29:19 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * include/pcode.h:
        * source/vm/hvm.c:
        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        Replaced _AND and _OR with AND_ and OR_.
        Under gcc, these two identifiers are defined out.
        Also, got rid of a few warnings.

        * source/rtl/files.c:
        Implemented a macro trick to allow compilation of
        FOPEN, FREAD and FWRITE.
        Turned off HAVE_POSIX_IO for gcc; it doesn't seem to work.
