  	+ New test module for GTSTD terminal driver.

  * source/rtl/gtstd/gtstd.c
      Submitted by "Fergus McDonald" <listsub@qvolution.com>
    ! changed some internal char * items to BYTE * to better match
      external functions
    ! Max row/col is 24/80 for unix compatible (would be better to
      do this for all)
    ! ReadKey implementation for unix compatible OS: ch value wasn't
      been initialised and only least-significant byte being set by
      fread() - upper byte of the int value was random, leading to
      spurious ReadKey return values
    ! Fixed missing/extra outputting of newline character in SetPos
      and Scroll functions
    ! Added use of backspace char to respond to leftward cursor
      repositioning requests
    ! Added output of BEL character for tone() calls, with tracking
      of system time to limit BEL outputs to 1 per second max

    I've only tested this under GNU/linux and gcc. The ReadKey is still
    only implemented for UNIX_COMPATIBLE_OS.

    Redirection of stdin/stdout still works ok. To preserve the ability
    to accept redirected stdin, I think maeans there should never be
    remapping of any keycodes in this driver. Would be nice to have a
    way to pass in ALT-C though.

     + Added default logic to auto symchronize all macro activations with the compile time switches of each respective module.
     + Added -kr to disable auto synching, thus allowing Run-Time setting by means of HB_SETMACRO().

   * source/rtl/seconds.c

     ! Fixed a few warnings inside hb_vmDo() and hb_vmSend()
   * source/vm/arrayshb.c

   * source/compiler/harbour.c
   * source/vm/macro.c
   * source/compiler/genc.c
     + Added logic to automatically synchronize HB_SETMACRO() level with the -k option supplied to compiler.

     /* HB_SETMACRO() may still be called explictly, but now specifying any -k option to harbour will automatically provide same
       level of functionalty in macro compiler. Example:

           harbour test -kc

        will restrict the compiler to the Clipper level mode, and will automatically disable extended macro support in that module
        without requiring:

           HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_HARBOUR, .F. )
           HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_XBASE, .F. )

        By default all harbour extensions are enabled - you can use -kc, -kx -ki, etc., to disable any unwanted feature.

        We should still review the need to have -ki which I find absolutley redundant and unproductive.

        * -kc (Clipper compatibility) clears all other switches (minimal
