   * source/rtl/tget.prg
     + TGet instance variable ordering in class definition 
       made CA-Cl*pper compatible, so that it's now possible to 
       access object vars as array elements the same way.
       Read-only access is strongly recommended when using this 
       unofficial access method, and the practice is overall 
       discouraged.
       NOTE: oGet[8] is not supported in Harbour.
             It holds U2Bin( ::nRow ) + U2Bin( ::nCol ) + trash 
             in CA-Cl*pper (untested).
       NOTE: when in focus, in oGet[11] (in C52 mode), oGet[17] 
             (in C53 mode) only the first char is compatible, 
             which is the type. The rest is trash in CA-Cl*pper.
       NOTE: The array length will always be different (higher) 
             in Harbour.

   * tests/rto_get.prg
     + Extended tests with regards to array access of the 
       TGet object.
