  * makefile.vc
    ! Fixed version by Matteo Baccan.

19990916-14:20 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

  * source/rtl/mouse/*.*
    * Copyright text format change.
  * source/rtl/gt/*.c
    ! Indentations, formatting errors corrected.
    ! // comments change to /**/
    + Copyright headers added.
  * source/rtl/inkey.c
    ! // comments change to /**/
  * source/rtl/gt/gt_tpl.c
    ! Fixed hb_gt_SetMode() return value type.
  * source/rtl/gtapi.c
    ! hb_gtRepChar() will check for buffer overflow.
  * include/gtapi.h
    ! Added hb_gt_Replicate() to GTAPI.H
    * Variable names revised, standardized.
  * source/rtl/errorapi.c
    * hb_errPutArgs() Now using Item API instead of Array API.

  * source/rtl/console.c 
    source/rtl/gtapi.c
    source/rtl/gt/*.c
    include/gtapi.h
    + API functions made more Clipper compatible with some arg type changes:
      hb_gtBox() - Character parameter: char * -> BYTE *
      hb_gtRepChar() - USHORT character changed to BYTE, this is not completely
           Clipper compatible, but I've considered a bug to accept a character 
           in an USHORT.
      hb_gtRest() - Buffer parameter: char * -> void *
      hb_gtSave() - Buffer parameter: char * -> void *
      hb_gtWrite*() - Character parameter: char * -> BYTE *
    * Some types changed in the low-level API.
      hb_gt_IsColor() - retval: int -> BOOL
      hb_gt_Get/SetCursorStyle() - int -> USHORT to match the high level API
      hb_gt_Puts() - char * -> BYTE *, int -> ULONG for the length.
      hb_gt_GetText() - char * -> BYTE *
      hb_gt_PutText() - char * -> BYTE *
      hb_gt_Replicate() - char -> BYTE, DWORD -> ULONG
    ; IMHO later we should change all unsigned coordinate types to signed ones,
      so that we can have a better "virtual screen" support. All attribute
      types to a generic HB_ATTR, all characters to HB_CHAR.

19990916-11:15 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + __XHELP() function added.
    ; So now if we had defined a function named HELP() in our app, it will be
      called by default if the user presses the F1 key. Like in Clipper.
    + Now using SYSINIT to force linking of the system init modul, instead of
      ERRORSYS. Forcing ERRORNEW explicitly is not needed, so it's now removed.
  * source/rtl/harbinit.prg
    + ANNOUNCE SYSINIT added.
    + __SETHELPK() function added.
  * source/rtl/harbinit.prg (added)
    source/rtl/errorsys.prg
    source/rtl/Makefile
    makefile.*
    ! ClipInit() INIT procedure moved from ERRORSYS to a separate .prg,
      this way the ERRORSYS.PRG module is completely replacable, like in 
      Clipper.
      ( ! Borland and MSVC users please check the modified Makefiles ! )
  * source/rtl/*.prg
    + All copyright header changed to the new one.
    + Missing copyright headers added.

19990916-13:07 GMT+3 Alexander Kresin

    + Added NOTE why pItemArg1 is needed.
  * tests/working/transdef.prg
    tests/broken/parexpr.prg
    - Removed (now for sure)

19990915-23:35 EDT Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
  * source/rtl/gt/gtos2.c
    source/rtl/gt/gtwin.c
    source/rtl/gt/gtdos.c
    include/gtapi.h
    * converted a number of parameters to USHORT, SHORT or BYTE

19990916-05:30 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    include/hberrors.h
    ! Proper error shown when more than one input (.prg) filenames are
      specified, it caused a leak previously and was not compatible with
      Clipper.
    ! Invalid filename message when the passed filename only contains dir/drive.
      GPF fixed.
  * *.bat
    tests/working/*.bat
    ! @echo off commands moved to the top of files.
  * tests/working/setkeys.prg
    ! Some functions names fixed, it still doesn't work because GetActive()
      function is not yet implemented.
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    tests/working/transdef.prg (removed)
    tests/working/Makefile
    * Tests from transdef.prg moved to rtl_test.prg (2 failures more now)
    tests/working/transdef.prg (removed)
  * tests/broken/parexpr.prg
    - Removed, since it's in working now.
  ; The bugs above were reported by Jose Lalin.
  * source/rtl/*.* (partial)
    + All copyright header changed to the new one.
    + Missing copyright headers added.

19990916-03:57 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

    source/tools/strfmt.c
    + All copyright header changed to the new one.
  * source/rtl/menuto.prg
    ! RELEASE (cVariable) changed to __MVRELEASE( cVariable ) since now
      to former is not preprocessed, which is fine BTW, since Clipper
      is doing the same.
  * make_tpl.*
    + mingw32 added as a new option.

19990916-03:17 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

  * source/hbpp/stdalone/hbpp.c
    source/hbpp/hbppint.c

    ! Formatting error corrected.

19990914-20:45 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  + config/win32/mingw32.cf
  * source/hbpp/hbpp.c
  * source/hbpp/hbppint.c

  * source/rtl/dir.c
  * source/rtl/environ.c
  * source/rtl/filesys.c

19990916-02:25 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

  * source/compiler/symbols.asm (removed)
    source/vm/symbols.asm (added)
    makefile.b31
    * Moved to VM since it belongs there.

    source/compiler/harbour.l
    source/compiler/harbour.y
    * Copyright text changed to the newer version.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    ! One buggy error message text fixed (%i format specifier removed).

19990915-17:40 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

  * include/itemapi.h
  * source/rtl/itemapi.c
    ! Added a third argument, PBH_ITEM pItemArg1, to the hb_itemDo()
      and hb_itemDoC() functions to solve a var-arg problem with the
      OS/2 version of GCC. When calling hb_itemDo() or hb_itemDoC() to
      evaluate a symbol, function, or code block that does not take
      any arguments, use '(PHB_ITEM *) 0' as the third argument.

  * config/win32/bcc32.cf
    ! The GNU make system now works with Borland 32-bit compilers.

  * config/win32/gcc.cf
    * Removed '-lmoldname' in order to avoid polluting the __CYGWIN__
      build with __MINGW32__ stuff.

  * source/compiler/harbour.l
    ! Removed 'extern int _bQuiet', because it conflicts with the
      'extern BOOL _bQuiet' declaration in include/compiler.h.

  * source/rtl/console.c
    ! Added __CYGWIN__ to the Unix-style input in HB___ACCEPT()

  * source/rtl/filesys.c
    ! Removed the alleged Cygwin mode flag fix, which turned out to
      be an incomptibility between the CYGWIN and MINGW32 libraries.

  * source/rtl/inkey.c
    ! Applied the Borland Windows fix supplied by Jose Lalin.
    ! Changed Cygwin support to use the Unix method in order to
      avoid polluting the __CYGWIN__ build with __MINGW32__ stuff.
    ! Moved the Unix keyboard input from hb_inkeyPoll() to hb_inkeyGet()
      in order to stop blocking the VM when it polls the keyboard.

  * tests/working/inkeytst.prg
    + Display a note regarding Unix-style keyboard input.
    ! Changed the final keyboard test exit key from ESC to TAB, because
      Unix-style keyboard input uses ESC as the lead-in for extended keys.

19990915-23:20 GMT+3 Alexander Kresin
  * source/hbpp/hbpp.c
  * source/hbpp/table.c
    * fixed some bugs, reported by Victor and Matteo

19990915-15:50 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * doc/hdr_tpl.txt
    * Some small changes.
  * include/*.api
    include/*.ch
    include/*.h
    + Added copyright header to all files, where the original author is not
      known, it's not filled.
    * Standardized the copyright header for all users.
    * ChangeLog sections separated from the copyright headers.
    * The one-liner file descriptions standardized.

19990915-14:14 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * doc/license.txt
    + Added a text file containing the license text.
  * doc/hdr_tpl.txt
    ! Typo fixed (now v1.8)

19990915-14:04 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/dir.c
    include/directry.ch
    ! printf()s commented out, proper (but silent) error handling added.
    + Now using directry.ch for the array format.
    + A TODO: added about changing the file composing/decomposing functionality
      to hb_fsFNameSplit()/Merge() functions.
    + NOTE added that the third parameter is a Harbour extension.
    % Some small logic streamlining.
    * Some variable names changes, some variable scopes adjusted.
  * source/compiler/genobj32.c
    + Every static thing is now declared static.
    + Missing prototypes added.
  * source/rtl/hardcr.c
    source/rtl/mtran.c
    source/tools/dates2.c
    * Slight change in the format of the copyright header, the text itself
      has not changed.
  * source/rtl/filesys.c
    + hb_fnFNameMerge() - TOFIX: added again about the lack of buffer overlow
      handling.
  * .cvsignore
    ! DOS/LINUX/OS2 GNU Make systems working directories added.
  * doc/hdr_tpl.txt
    + Some fine tunings, see the files own history. The copyright text hasn't
      changed. Version 1.7
  * include/std.ch
    include/Makefile
    + Added a skeleton and a TODO for the STD.CH file.

19990915-11:15 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/dir.c
    ! Two warnings fixed about possibly missing paranthesis.
    + Reformatted.
  * source/rtl/adir.prg
    ! Default flags reset to "HSD"
  * tests/working/adirtest.prg
    ! Fixed a bug which caused an error when zero files was found.
    + Added: SET DATE ANSI, SET CENTURY ON
    ! Newline handling made platform compatible.
    ! Some other fixes.
  * source/rtl/memvars.c
    ! Typos fixed.

19990915-03:40 EDT Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>
  * source/rtl/dir.c
    * Now Clipper compatible results are returned.
      definately with MSVC - most likely with compilers running under MS OS.
      since I'm not familliar with any quirks with those compilers I made
      almost no changes to compiler specific code.  I suspect though that
      there may be problems when passing a full path with wildcard to
      Directory() - please test.
    + You can now get the 8.3 filename (msvc again) for true Clipper
      compatibible return results by passing a logical as the new 3rd
      parameter. The default is .f. which gives full long filenames
    + Add a number of static funcs like HarbourMaskToAttributes() to
      convert "DHS" to something the os understands.
    ! Where this all falls apart is for OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE.
      I don't know what to do about translating Hidden or System files.
      and not too sure how to handle Readonly.
      Nobody commented when I posted the code - so here is what I came up
      with.
  * tests/working/dirtest.prg
    + added 3rd parameter to indicate 'want 8.3 filenames'

19990915-03:20 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/rtl/do.c
    - Previous fix undone, since it was causing other problems.

19990915-02:20 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * .cvspass
    - File removed, since it was probably added by incident.

19990915-01:22 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/compiler/gen*.c
    + some fflush() calls added to see a better feedback about the progress
      of the generation process.

19990915-00:38 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * tests/working/sound.prg
    tests/working/*.bat
    tests/working/*.ch
    + CVS header added to all files.
    + @echo off added where missing.

19990915-00:30 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * (*.* in the root directory)
    + CVS header added to all files.
    + @echo off added where missing.
  * build32.bat
    build40.bat
    build31.bat
    build.bat (renamed)
    build16.bat (new)
    buildrdd.bat (removed)
    bldgt32.bat (removed)
    bldhbpp.bat (removed)
    % These three batch files has been incorporated to the main build
      batch files, since they were simple one-liners.
    ! hbpplib.b32 build process was executed two times from the build32.bat
      and build40.bat files.
    * build.bat renamed to build16.bat

19990914-17:30 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * config/rules.cf
    * Harbour flag /q changed to /q0 to omit the compiler header.
  * source/rtl/do.c
    ! DO() fixed to use hb_dynsymFind() instead of hb_dynsymGet(),
      now it properly displays when the passed string is not a symbol, rather
      then throwing an internal error.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    + /CREDITS command line switch to display the development team. Like in
      Clipper.

19990914-13:15 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    source/compiler/gen*.c
    + Help screen made more Clipper like.
    + /f switch changed to /gf, and the whole object generation build
      in to the source in a more standard way. It works now.
    + /q0 switch added to the help screen.
    + All filename composing stuff related to specific output types moved to
      the appropriate gen*.c file. This way the code is more modular.
    ! One variable made static in genobj32.c

19990914-11:40 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/runner/stdalone/external.prg
    include/external.ch
    * Regenerated.
  * source/runner/runlib.c
    ! Made some steps to release memory blocks when an undeclared symbol error
      occurs, seemingly with few success. This needs some more work.
    + TODO added about a possible direction for further development.
      The idea would be to replicate the Blinker DLL functionality.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    source/compiler/harbour.l
    source/compiler/gen*.c
    * Only every 100th line number is shown on the counter while parsing,
      this way it's more Clipper like. In theory it should also be faster,
      but due to the stdout buffering, it's approx. the same speed. Though it
      could be faster in some platform/compiler/screen output combinations.
    + The "syntax ok" message is now replaced with the total number of
      functions and the total number of lines. Similar to Clipper, but not
      so specific to the generated output.
    + /q0 switch no suppresses the "Harbour Compiler" header.
    + The "Generating ... output" line format changed, it's now more
      compact.
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    + A new VAL() test added to test the huge value problem.
    ! One failure eliminated by hiding a filename generating difference in
      __COPYFILE(), NOTE added about this.
  * source/rtl/strings.c
    + HB_VAL() now uses hb_retnlen().
    ! HB_VAL() was incompatible for huge integer values (5000000000). This
      is fixed.
  * source/rtl/memvars.c
    * __MVRESTORE() is now using hb_itemPutNLen()
  * source/rtl/extend.c
    include/extend.h
    + hb_retnlen() Extend API function added, which is a wrapper for
      hb_itemPutNLen().
  * source/rtl/itemapi.c
    include/itemapi.h
    + hb_itemPutNLen() generic function added to assign a number to an item,
      the low-level type of the number is automatically selected, based on the
      magnitude and presence of decimal places. Similar to hb_vmPushNumber().
    + hb_itemPutN?Len() functions will now accept any negative width/dec
      parameters as a request for the default. So:
      For iDec now any negative number will do the same as -1 before.
      For iWidth now any negative number will do the same as 0 before.
      This way the interface is more fool proof and consistent.

19990914-01:00 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    include/ctoharb.h
    + hb_vmEqual() - Added support for alternate equal operator: "="
      Currently they are exact synonyms.
    + hb_vmInc()/hb_vmDec() - "++", "--" operator overloading support added.
    + hb_stackDispLocal() - More values are printed, the format changed.
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    tests/working/overload.prg
    ! The tests fixed again, "+="/"-=" operators removed from the class
      declaration.
    * "+"/"-" implementation changed to not modify the original value, since
      the expression "oString + 'A'" in itself in one line is not valid anyway.
    + "++", "--" operator overloading added.
    - Removed the "<>" and "#" overloading methods since they were not needed
      in this case.

19990913-23:45 GMT+1 Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + hb_vmInString() - Added support for overloading the "$" operator.
    ! hb_vmPlus() - Fixed the operator overloading feature.
    + hb_vmNotEqual() - Added support for alternate notequal operators:
      "<>" and "#".
  * tests/working/rtl_test.prg
    tests/working/overload.prg
    - Removed +=, -= tests, since they will destroy the object, basically
      this gets executed: oString := oString + "Hello", where the right side
      expression will result in a string, which gets assigned to the object.
      This could be fixed by changing the overloader block to return self BTW,
      but from the test point of view, this is the same as "+"/"-".
