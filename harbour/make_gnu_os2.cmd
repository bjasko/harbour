rem In GCC3.2.2 the TCP/IP headers and libraries scheme have been changed.
rem The default is the current OS/2 tcpip toolkit (BSD 4.4 based).
rem To target the older OS/2 tcpip stack (BSD 4.3 based) and create
rem binaries which can be executed also on older OS2 versions you must
rem define TCPV40HDRS before including any TCP/IP headers and make
rem sure usr/lib/tcpipv4 is searched before usr/lib (this is to
rem get the right libsocket). It is recommended to use the -D
rem compiler option for the define and either the LIBRARY_PATH or
rem the -L compiler/linker option for the library.
rem For building Harbour you can also use L_USR environment variable,
rem f.e.
rem         SET L_USR=-Le:\usr\lib\tcpipv4
rem 
rem If you are using newer OS2 version with tcp/ip stack >= 4.1
rem (eComStation, for example) and you do not need backward binary
rem compatibility then you can disable it by setting HB_OS2_TCP32
rem environment variable, f.e.
rem         SET HB_OS2_TCP32=yes

if "%HB_OS2_TCP32%" == "yes" goto tcp32
if "%HB_OS2_TCP32%" == "YES" goto tcp32
