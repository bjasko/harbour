/*  $DOC$
 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *      ASCIISUM()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      CT3 string functions
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      calculate the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in a string
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      ASCIISUM (<cString>) --> nAsciiSum
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <cString>      the string to be processed
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      <nAsciiSum>    sum of the ASCII values in <cString>
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      The ASCIISUM() function sums up the ASCII values of the characters
 *      in <cString>. Be aware that the function is not position sensitive,
 *      i.e. a change of position of a certain character in the string does
 *      not change the ascii sum.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      ? asciisum ("ABC")  -->  197
 *      ? asciisum ("ACB")  -->  197
 *  $TESTS$
 *      asciisum (replicate ("A", 10000)) == 650000 
 *      asciisum ("0123456789") == 525              
 *      asciisum (nil) == 0                         
 *  $STATUS$
 *      Ready
 *  $COMPLIANCE$
 *      ASCIISUM() is compatible with CT3's ASCIISUM().
 *  $PLATFORMS$
 *      All
 *  $FILES$
 *      Source is asciisum.c, library is ct3.
 *  $SEEALSO$
 *      CHECKSUM()
 *  $END$
