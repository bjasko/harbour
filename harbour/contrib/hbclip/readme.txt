Harbour Compatibility Library (HCL) for CA-Cl*pper 5.x
======================================================

The goal of this library and header file is to provide some level
of compatibility for Harbour code when compiled with CA-Cl*pper.

You will require Microsoft C 5.1 or 8.x and CA-Cl*pper to compile
and build this library.

Use MAKE_CLP.BAT to build the library.

Later on add HBCLIP.LIB to your link script.

Optionally you may want to #include "hbclip.ch" to 
your source files.
