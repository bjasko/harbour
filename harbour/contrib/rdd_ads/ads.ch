   If you are want to use functions from ADS version 6 or later
   (data dictionary support, built-in Internet Server
   capabilities, etc.), you must do two things:

   1) Link with an ACE32.LIB created from the version 6 or
         later dll that imports these functions, and
   2) Set this "define" when compiling rddads:

   #define ADS_REQUIRE_VERSION6

   Otherwise, any version of ADS will work but you won't have
   the extra functionality available past v.5.
