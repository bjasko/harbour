The following bugs have been recovered from h090599 :

1. Makefile.b16 + .b32
2. Second() functions renamed

The following bugs are unresolved :

1. Eval is loosing memory
   aEval is fine; Eval looses them somewhere (no Return argument??)
2. Dates & Set_Test and Test10 crash during compile
3. TestId is broken
	Does not compile without /dTEST
	Crashes with /dTEST
        It decides to do something different though :-)

Some warnings left and right
