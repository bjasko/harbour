There are two strip files here :

#1 : strip.prg          This one is broken
#2 : strip2.prg         This one works

You'll need to the latest FILES.C for this + my harbour.y patch.

The first one uses the TClass().

The second one uses the Class functions.

The STATIC which is used, is removed (set to NIL) once you are done.

Good luck
