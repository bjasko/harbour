There are four strip files here :

#1 : strip.prg          This one is broken
#2 : strip2.prg         This one works
#3 : strip3.prg         Broken as well
#4 : strip4.prg         Works. Includes TClass()

You'll need to the latest FILES.C for this + my harbour.y patch.

The first one uses the TClass().

The second one uses the Class functions.

The third one uses the TClass() but store ClassH in the static.

The fourth one has TClass() in the .PRG.

The STATIC which is used, is removed (set to NIL) once you are done.


Good luck

Eddie
