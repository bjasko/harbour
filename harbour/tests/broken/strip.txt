Strip

Strip is a program which copies the infile to the outfile.

The reason why this program is still broken is because there is still a
discussion about the file format

Newline     = chr(10) or chr(13)+chr(10)
End of file = chr(0) or chr(26)

Another reason is that the fRead does not work properly yet.

The program now uses fReadStr, which reads a single character at a time

The TextFile class has been designed to allow to read (large) blocks.

Good luck
