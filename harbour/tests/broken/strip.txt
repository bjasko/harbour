There are two strip files here :

#1 : strip.prg          This one is broken
#2 : strip2.prg         This one works
#3 : strip3.prg         Broken as well

You'll need to the latest FILES.C for this + my harbour.y patch.

The first one uses the TClass().

The second one uses the Class functions.

The third one uses the TClass() but store ClassH in the static.

The STATIC which is used, is removed (set to NIL) once you are done.


Good luck

Eddie
