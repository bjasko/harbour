 tstdspac

 This program demonstrates that the 4 diskspace related functions work
 correctly for disks of any size.

 Certain os's may allow limits to the amount of disk space available to
 a user.  If that is the case, you should see a difference between
 the return value of DiskSpace() and DiskFree().

 Currently, Disk quota's are only implimented for NT.

 NOTE: Unlike Clipper, these functions return a floating point number!
