          Topic                              Responsible developer(s)
===================================          =========================

Mlctopos() and Mpostolc()                    Ignacio Ortiz

SET listener API                             David Holm

DBFCDX support                               Ryszard Glab

Fixing internal HVM/RTL handling of string   ???
items (Clipper passes a pointer to the same
allocated memory instead of creating
string copies)

Finish HbMake                                Luiz Rafael Culik

CaClipper remaining classes                  Luiz Rafael Culik

Map Harbour functions 10 chars to be         Luiz Rafael Culik
compatible with Caclipper

Optimize out the need for the PUSHNIL        ???
opcode before each function call.

Eliminate the "#pragma pack" type of hacks   ???
from the code (especially RDD), to make it
more multiplatform. This mostly involves
changing the direct writing of structures
to the disk.

OO system                                    Jean-Francois Lefebvre (JFL)
   Adding Class Method
   Adding Multiple Constructor
   Adding Class init Support



Integrate floating point methods to          ???
avoid inequalities at 13 or more
decimals.  See DETAILS_FLOAT below.

Add missing 5.3 ord* functions.              Brian Hays
OrdKeyVal and others are still in
dummy.prg. Move dbcmd.c

'SAVE TO' statement doesn't work             ???
like clipper's.  Is memofile
support complete?

DETAILS_FLOAT
   The building of the double in val.c is simply different than how it
   gets created when coded in source or read from a dbf
   See Harbour archives under the subject
      Some numbers are not as equal as others
