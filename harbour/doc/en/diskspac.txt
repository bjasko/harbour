/*  $DOC$
 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *      DISKSPACE()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      Low level disk information
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Get the amount of space available on a disk
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      DISKSPACE( [<nDrive>] [, <nType>] ) --> nDiskbytes
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <nDrive> The number of the drive you are requesting info on where 1 = A,
 *      2 = B, etc. For 0 or no parameter, DiskSpace will operate on the current
 *      drive.  The default is 0   

 *      <nType> The type of space being requested.  The default is HB_DISK_AVAIL.   
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      <nDiskBytes> The number of bytes on the requested disk that match the
 *      requested type.   
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      By default, this function will return the number of bytes of
 *      free space on the current drive that is available to the user
 *      requesting the information.   
 *
 *      There are 4 types of information available:   
 *
 *       HB_FS_AVAIL    The amount of space available to the user making the
 *                      request.  This value could be less than HB_FS_FREE if
 *                      disk quotas are supported by the O/S in use at runtime,
 *                      and disk quotas are in effect.  Otherwise, the value
 *                      will be equal to that returned for HB_FS_FREE.

 *       HB_FS_FREE     The actual amount of free diskspace on the drive.

 *       HB_FS_USED     The number of bytes in use on the disk.

 *       HB_FS_TOTAL    The total amount of space allocated for the user if
 *                      disk quotas are in effect, otherwise, the actual size
 *                      of the drive.   
 *
 *      If information is requested on a disk that is not available, a runtime
 *      error 2018 will be raised.   
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      ? "You can use : " +Str( DiskSpace() ) + " bytes " +;
 *        "Out of a total of " + Str( DiskSpace(0,HB_FS_TOTAL) )
 *      </fixed>
 *  $STATUS$
 *      R
 *  $COMPLIANCE$
 *      CA-Clipper will return an integer value which limits it's usefulness to
 *      drives less than 2 gigabytes.  The Harbour version will return a
 *      floating point value with 0 decimals if the disk is > 2 gigabytes.
 *      <nType> is a Harbour extension.   
 *  $FILES$
 *      Library is Rtl.lib
 *      Header is Fileio.ch
