 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *Language extensions:
 *--------------------
 *
 ** Class generation and management.
 *
 *        Clipper only allowed creation of objects from a few standard
 *        classes.
 *        In Harbour, you can create your own classes--complete with
 *        Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Inheritance.
 *        Entire applications can be designed and coded in Object Oriented
 *        style.
 *
 ** @<FunctionName>()
 *        Returns the pointer (address) to a function.
 *
 *        The returned value is not useful to application-level programming, but
 *        is used at a low level to implement object oriented coding.
 *        (Internally, a class method is a static function and there is no
 *        symbol for it, so it is accessed via its address).
 *
 ** Class TGetList
 *        Object oriented support for GetLists management.
 *
 ** ProcName() support for class Method names.
 *        Class Methods can be retrieved from the call stack.
 *
 ** Memory() has new return values.
 *        See hbmemory.ch
 *
 ** Transform()  --> new function in format string
 *        @0      Make a zero padded string out of the number.
 *
 ** Optional Compile Time STRONG TYPE declaration (and compile time TYPE
 *  MISMATCH warnings)
 *
 *  Example: LOCAL/STATIC Var AS ...
 *
 ** The Harbour debugger provides new interesting classes:
 *  - Class TDbWindow could be the foundation for a generic multiplatform
 *  - Class TForm
 *  - Class TDbMenu implement both pulldown and popup menus.
 *
 *
 *
 *RTL enhanced functionality:
 *---------------------------
 *
 *- Directory( <cMask>, <cFlags>, <lEightDotThree> )
 *  The 3rd parameter is a Harbour (optional) parameter and indicates that on
 *  those platforms that support long filenames, that you wish to receive what
 *  would be considered the dos equivalant 8.3 name.
 *  Could affect Adir() and Dir if they were modified to take advantage
 *  of it - currently, they will return long names if the os supports it.
 *
