Language extensions:
--------------------

* Classes generation and management (Clipper never provided this)
* @<FunctionName>()  --> returns the pointer (address) to a function
* Class TGetList  --> object oriented support for GetLists management
* ProcName() support for methods names.
* Memory() new returned values.
* Optional Compile Time STRONG TYPE declaration (and compile time TYPE
  MISMATCH warnings) Ex.: LOCAL/STATIC Var AS ...
* The Harbour debugger provides new interesting classes:
  - Class TDbWindow could be the foundation for a generic multiplatform
  - Class TForm
  - Class TDbMenu implement both pulldown and popup menus.



RTL enhanced functionality:
---------------------------

- Directory( <cMask>, <cFlags>, <lEightDotThree> )
  The 3rd parameter is a Harbour (optional) parameter and indicates that on
  those platforms that support long filenames, that you wish to receive what
  would be considered the dos equivalant 8.3 name.
  Could affect Adir() and Dir if they were modified to take advantage
  of it - currently, they will return long names if the os supports it.
