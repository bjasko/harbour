Harbour directory structure
===========================

Follow are the various directories that exist under the Harbour tree.
Under each directory exist in this list there is also a special directory
named CVS, which should normally ignored since it is used by the CVS to keep
track of all files (read the FAQ if you don't know what CVS is). Note that
the tree might contain other empty directories, they might be obsolete but
there is no simple way to remove them completely (you can use: cvs update -d
in order to remove empty directories)
