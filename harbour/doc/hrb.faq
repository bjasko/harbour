.HRB FAQ list 1999/05/19:

Current only available in a 32bit Intel version.

HRB structure (also known as Harbour Portable Objects) and
Runner (also known as TugBoat, Stubbing Executables (not yet) )

To create a runner :

        c:..> bld32exe runner

Once the runner is created,
To create a .HRB and run it :

        c:..> stub <filename>


If you just want to run a .HRB file :

        c:..> runner <filename with .HRB>

If you just want to create a .HRB file :

        Use command-line switch -gHRB when invoking Harbour

To see the contents of a .HRB file :

        c:...> clipper readhrb /n/a/w           {I am sorry}
        c:...> blinker @readhrb
        c:...> readhrb <filename without .HRB>  {What do mean consistent}

        If it goes too fast a readhrb.out is created containing the screen
        output.

To run a .HRB file within a .PRG (only possible if the .PRG is compiled as a
.HRB file) :

        HB_Run( <cFileName> )

Adding new RTL/Tools commands to Harbour.

        Since the runner needs to known all symbols recognized by Harbour
        up-front an include file "run_exp.h" is available.

        If a new function is added to the RTL/Tools an entry must be made
        into this file for the runner to recognize the symbol.

        ...
        HARBOUR <new_func>();
        ...
        { "<new_func>", FS_PUBLIC, <new_func>(), 0 },
        ...

        Unless a new system for 'Static initializers' is implemented.

        run_exp.h currently contains all functions except :
        IO.C and some internal functions (ie __wDataInc)

HRB structure (also known as Harbour Portable Objects) and
Runner (also known as TugBoat, Stubbing Executables (not yet) )

Version 1.0

The ultimate version will of course feature more, but let's just stick to the
minimal requirements.

The .HRB structure consists :

<ulSymbols>       Long containing the number of symbols
{
    <szSymbol>    Name of symbol
    <bScope>      Scope of symbol
    <bLinkType>   Link type :
                  0 = NO_LINK (ie DATA symbol)
                  1 = FUNCTION* in .PRG itself
                  2 = EXTERN. Link function pointer at run-time.
}
<ulFuncs>         Long containing the number of functions
{
    <szSymbol>    Name of function
    <ulLen>       Length of function
    <aPCode>      PCode of function
}

* Since the module name itself is a symbol during compilation. ProcName()
  was recognized as an internal function.
  During the run-time link the runner therefore checks whether the compiler
  has correctly identified a symbol as contained in .PRG itself.
