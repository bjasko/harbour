- GNU and non-GNU make system configuration moved closer to each 
  other.
- Reviewed and fixed platforms issues and compiler warnings 
  for the contrib area in most part.
- Enhanced contrib 64bit Windows compatibility.

Core
=============================
- __HARBOUR__ macro will now contain value in 0xAABBCC form, where 
  AA, BB and CC are the major, minor and revision numbers in hex.
  This is incompatible, as in previous version .c level __HARBOUR__ 
  did return 0xAABB, while on .prg level it had no value.
- Deprecated hb_itemPutCPtr(). Please use hb_itemPutCLPtr() instead.
- Deprecated hb_errFuncName public var. Please use HB_ERR_FUNCNAME macro instead. 
- Added hb_itemPutCPtr2().

  some event callbacks, close button control)
- Changed SetCancel() interpretation in GTWVT.
- hbpp now uses the same engine as the Harbour compiler.
- Added Set( _SET_HBOUTLOG[, <cFileName>] ), Set( _SET_HBOUTLOGINFO[, <cInfo>] ) 
  to customize GPF and memory leak logging.
- Added better GPF dumps for Windows.
- Fixed clipboard handling on Windows under certain situations.
- Optimizations and minor fixes.

- GTWVG contrib enhancements.
- Added SQL_SPRINTF() to hbmisc contrib.
- Enhanced STRFORMAT() in hbmisc contrib.
- Enabled hbgf contrib for all (Linux, OS/2, Windows) platforms.
- Due to fixing 64bit portability problems, some functions became 
  incompatible, because numeric addresses have been converted to 
  pointer types:
  - hbwhat32: wndproc/dlgproc parameters in related functions.
  - hbmysql: SQLCONNECT(), SQLSTORER(), SQLUSERES()
  - hbmsql: MSQLSTORER(), MSQLLISTFI()
- Removed function CEIL() from hbmisc. Please use CEILING() from hbct 
  instead.

Version 1.0.0 rc1 (2008-06-04) tag: 1.0.0rc1

General
=============================
- The SourceForge repository was moved from CVS to SVN
- added docs/howtosvn.txt
- changed pack_src.sh to extract list of files from local SVN copy using
  SVN commands
- improved CYGWIN compatibility
- new alternative make system for BCC, MSVC and GCC (maybe others in the
  future) which uses common dependences list. The old GNU make system is
  still functional and working
- added support for pure C MSVC builds (not C++)
- added rules to generate DEB packages - by Luis Mayoral taken from Debian
  distribution updated for current code
- added new man pages and updated the old ones taken from Debian
- fully removed flex and bison dependences in normal builds. Only developers
  who want to change the grammar files needs bison
- removed all HB_COMPAT_XHB definitions from source code - now all covered
  extensions should be supported by hbcompat.ch and/or xhb library
- removed 3-rd party header files from SVN, f.e.: ace.h

Portability
-----------
- eliminated errno access for platforms which do not have it.
- added support for PocketPC WINCE with MSVC, POCC, CeGCC and MinGWCE.
- added support for cross WinCE builds
- extended hb* scripts for cross builds: hbw* - Win32, hbce* - WinCE
- added support for creating RPMs with Harbour cross build for Win32 and
  WinCE.
- added support for MS-Windows UNICDE builds.
- added support for shared libraries (.sl) in HPUX builds
- added large file support (64bit) in HPUX builds
- disabled in default BSD* builds DOS/Windows DENY_* flags emulation
  implemented by BSD locks - tests on FreeBSD 6.2 and MacOSX shows
  that it badly interacts with POSIX locks and it's possible to create
  deadlock.

The compiler
==============================
syntax:
-------
- added direct support to compiler for ENDSW[ICTH], ENDDO, ENDC[ASE], ENDI[F],
  ENDW[ITH], ENDSEQ[UENCE]
  Now they are not translated by preprocessor to END what allows better typos
  detection in .prg code because each statement can use its own unique close
  directive
- forbidden using EXIT and LOOP inside ALWAYS code in BEGIN/END sequence
- forbidden using ALWAYS statement if RECOVER code has EXIT or LOOP
  statement
- removed some restrictions on reserved words like using IF, IIF, _FIELD
  as field name
- added support for (@var):<msg>
- fixed many syntax expressions which where accepted by grammar definition
  but not supported by compiler, f.e. @func(p)
- added support for HB_ENUM*([@]<varname>) functions - disabled
  by default can be enabled by HB_USE_ENUM_FUNCTIONS macro
- added support for DYNAMIC functions - references resolved at runtime.

internals:
----------
- fixed LOOP used inside SWITCH/CASE.../END[SWITCH] statements
- fixed using EXIT/LOOP inside WITH OBJECT / END[WITH] statement
- fixed optimization of empty BEGIN/END sequence when recover has
  EXIT or LOOP statement
- fixed using EXIT/LOOP inside extended codeblocks when loop is
  external to codeblock definition
- fixed using RETURN inside extended codeblocks when they are defined
  inside BEGIN SEQUENCE statement
- many other fixes for problems which can appears in nested extended
  codeblock definitions
- fixed problems with line numbering in extended code blocks
- fixed compiler -w3 warning when class has different name then class
  function.
- optimizations in generated PCODE and extended compile time optimizations
- added support for --version compiler switch for platforms which
  use '-' as option separator
- added new compiler switches:
   -q2 - disable _ALL_ stdout/stderr messages
   -kM - turn off macrotext substitution
   -ks - changed to pass base value by reference what allow full []
    operator overloading
- added new compiler switches for automatic filename, pathname and path
  separators translations (-fn*, -fd*, -fs*, -fp*) used for file open
  during compilation
- added support for dynamically set during compilation ChangeLog entry,
  ChangeLog ID, SVN revision and compilation flags.
  Update Harbour logo message to show the exact revision number and
- removed non-working compiler frontends: .NET CLI and JAVA.
- added support for i18n into compiler (-j[<filename>] switch)
  gettext compatible .pot files are generated

preprocessor:
-------------
- added support for logical constants .T., .F., .Y., .N. in
  #IF ... / #ELIF ... PP directives
- added support for changing all -k? switches by #pragma, f.e.;
         #pragma -ks+
         #pragma -kM-
         #pragma -kx1
         #pragma -kJ0
- added to PP predefined defines: HB_VER_LENTRY, HB_VER_CHLID, HB_VER_SVNID
  with ChangeLog entry, ChangeLog ID and SVN revision
- added to PP support for:
      #pragma __[c]streaminclude "fileName"|<code with %s result marker>

The runtime modules
=============================
- renamed core libraries
- cleaned code and guards all extensions to pure CL5[23] with HB_EXTENSION
  macro.
- turned off HB_EXTENSION for the default builds.

API
---
- added C functions to access SET values (hb_setGet*()) which should be used
  instead of direct accessing HB_SET structure
- added hb_fsFileExists() and hb_fsDirExists()
- added hb_arraySet*() functions - they should help 3-rd party developers
  to eliminate using C stack level HB_ITEM and reduce usage of potentially
  danger function like hb_arrayGetItemPtr()
- added hb_itemParamStore[Forward]() functions
- added hb_dateMilliSeconds()

VM
--
- FOR EACH detached enumerators now does not change on next iterations
- added support for scalar classes with operator overloading
- added full support for passing object items by reference even if they
  are not real variables but SETGET methods
- added support for setting string characters by assigning FOR EACH
  iterator, f.e.: FOR EACH c IN (@cVar)
                     c := Upper( c )
                  NEXT
- added full support for FOR EACH overloading
- extended PROCFILE() function - now it can accept <nLevel> | <sFuncSym> |
  <cFuncName> as first parameter, f.e.: PROCFILE( @someFunc() ) or
  PROCFILE( "PUBLICFUNC" ) or PROCFILE( nStackLevel ). For non character
  parameters it fully works also for static functions even if source code
  have many static functions with the same name
- added support for detecting not cleanly overloaded by linker .prg
  functions.
- cleaned PCODE module unload procedure.
- added support for executing all inherited multiple object destructors.

DEBUGGER
--------
- many fixes and extensions in debugger code mostly by Phil Krylov borrowed
  from xHarbour
- added to debugger support for inspecting objects which use hidden
  methods and members with the same names in different classes in
  inheritance tree - now context is dynamically changed

RTL
---
- added functions for translation to/from UTF8 mode and operations
  on UTF8 strings
- added functions for bit manipulations: HB_BIT*() and for conversions
  to/from hexadecimal format
- added set of functions with hb_ prefix supported extended parameters,
  f.e.: HB_AINS(), HB_ADEL(), HB_ASCAN(), HB_RASCAN(), HB_GETENV(),
  HB_AT(), ...
- added HB_FILEEXISTS(), HB_DIREXISTS()
- new TBROWSE class which is now very highly compatible with Clipper
  It should resolve 99.9% problems with BROWSE reported in the past.
- TBCOLUMN class is now fully Clipper compatible
- many fixes and cleanups in TGET class
- many fixes to GETSYS functionality, especially 5.3 compatible features.
- many fixes and cleanups in CL53 classes like TOPBAR, POPUP, MENUSYS,
  MENUITEM
  and related functions.
- Made C5.3 UI classes fully working and compatible.
- ERROR class rewritten in C so now it's possible to create new error
  objects also with active exceptions
- added missing support for _SET_FILECASE, _SET_DIRCASE switches in some
  functions
- added _SET_TRIMFILENAME - when enabled low level hb_fs*() functions strip
  trailing and leading spaces from file names to emulate DOS like behavior
- added support for _SET_DEFEXTENSIONS to native all RDDs
- many fixes in transform() function and fixed 64bit integer transformation.
  Now transform() passes our all compatibility tests
- added undocumented Clipper error functions
- added functions to manage .ini files: HB_INI*()
- extended HB_KEYPUT to support strings and arrays.
- converted HIDDEN methods and members in RTL objects to PROTECTED for
  easier class extension in user code
- added many undocumented Clipper's C and .prg functions.
- added hbzlib and Harbour level compression functions.
- PCRE library updated to version 7.7.

MACRO COMPILER
--------------
- removed some restrictions on reserved words like using IF, IIF, _FIELD
  as field name

COMPILER
--------
- added support for full compiler code integration with compiled programs
  WARNING: Please remember that compiler in Harbour is covered by pure GPL
  license and final programs should respect it so use compiler library
  only with programs which respects GPL.

GT:
---
- Added new GT driver GTTRM. It's terminal GT which can be used in different
  *nixes. Unlike GTCRS or GTSLN it does not use any external libraries
  like [n]curses or slang or databases with terminal description (termcap/
  terminfo). It has hard coded support only for few terminals (Linux,ANSI,
  XTERM) but because uses only very limited set of escape sequences then
  on most currently used terminals it works better then curses or slang
  based programs. GTTRM automatically detects ISO/UTF8 terminal mode at
  startup and chose valid output what should also help *nix users - it
  resolves problems with some box drawing characters and others which
  are not accessible in ISO mode. It also respects /etc/harbour/hb-charmap.def
  like GTCRS.
  As long as user code does not execute and full screen commands then
  it works like GTSTD so can be used also for simple stream programs.
- added new GT driver GTWVG. It's works like GTWVT but has additional
  support for GUI elements
- changed GTI_* defines to HB_GTI_*
- added optional hb_gtInfo() switch HB_GTI_COMPATBUFFER which can force
  using DOS compatible video buffers in all GTs. Anyhow please remember
  that it may cause that some extended information stored by GT driver
  in video buffer will be lost.
- added HB_GTI_ADDKEYMAP and HB_GTI_DELKEYMAP to define/remove new
  escape key sequences in terminal based GTs. It's supported by
  GTCRS and GTTRM
- fixed color string decoding to be fully Clipper compatible
- OUTSTD()/OUTERR() respects automatic CP translation when they
  are not redirected to GT screen
- added common for all GTs CLIPBOARD support. If possible low level GT
  drivers uses system clipboard otherwise they emulate it for Harbour
  application only

Multilangual:
-------------
- added new lang and codepage modules: SK, BG, BE, HR, UA, LT, SV, etc.
- updated codepage code for better handling accented and multibyte
  characters.

RDD
=============================
- added support for memo file packing in PACK operation
- added new DBF fields like: AUTOINC (+), ROWVERSION (^), TIME (T),
  DAYTIME (@/T), MODTIME (=), binary integers with fixed decimal places, etc.
- removed limit for maximum size of relation string expression
- fixed registering workareas with numbers from 65280 to 65534.
- added SIX3 compatible library - now Harbour supports all SIX3 functions
  and extensions like triggers. The HiPer-SEEK and CFTS (HS_*() and CFS*()
  functions) was added before in hsx library. Now only bitmap filters
  (m6_*() functions) are not supported in SVN Harbour version.

Contrib
=============================
- renamed contrib libraries
- TIP library borrowed from xHarbour and adopted to Harbour
- added HBCURL - libcurl interface library. (rooted from the 
  xHarbour version, but heavily fixed and further developed.)
- added HBSQLIT3 - SQLite 3.x Harbour callable library.
- fixes in MySQL and PGSQL library
- cleanup and many fixes in NF library
- cleanup code of CT3 library with many modifications and fixes
- most of in/out CT3 functions rewritten to use GT API so now they can work
  on all platforms and with all GTs
- added support for contrib libraries and new make system
- many contrib libraries borrowed from xHarbour code
- added xHarbour compatibility library: xhb. It emulates many of xHarbour
  behavior which cannot be covered by PP rules like extended operators,
  strings like arrays, one byte string in math operations, HB_ENUMINDEX(),
  HB_QWith(), HB_QSelf(), accessing hash item using OOP interface,
  accessing/assigning string characters using [] operators (many of the
  above fully works only in Harbour but not in native xHarbour code :-))
  and many extensions like HBLOG, HBXML, HBCSTRUCT, HASH, INET*(), etc.
- added HBTPATHY - Telepath(y) compatible comm. library.
- added HBWHAT32 - Windows API interface.
- added HBFBIRD - Firebird db access interface.
- added hbcompat.ch file which hides many differences between Harbour
  and xHarbour compilers using PP directives.
- added hbmzip library - it's wrapper to MINIZIP library which
  allows for compress and decompress streams, character variables, 
  .gz and .zip files
- fixes and extensions in ADORDD
- added automatic ACE version detection during building ADSRDD
- added many new Ads*() functions wrappers and cleaned code for
  possible GPFs when wrong parameters were passed to some functions
- added HBHPDF - interface for Haru Free PDF Library.
- added HBVPDF - Viktor K's PDF Library + Pritpal Bedi's OOP extension.
- enhanced and fixed HBW32 library - OLE and printing

Utilities
=============================
- added HBDOT utility program. It's a "Dot Prompt" Console for the
  Harbour Language
         Syntax:  hbdot [<hrbfile[.prg]> [<parameters,...>]]
   It should look and work in similar way to pp/xBaseScript
   by Ron Pinkas but unlike xBaseScript is does not have preprocessor
   or simulated runtime environment but simply uses Harbour pp and
   compiler libraries to preprocess and compile commands. It means
   that it supports all language constructions also statements, f.e.:
         "for i:=1 to 10; ? i; next"
   Additionally it can also compile and execute .prg files given as
   first parameter just like hbrun.
- added many new tests to hbtest
- renamed ppgen to hbppgen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- cleaned the syntax and strange unsupported but accepted by [macro]compiler
  constructions
- added BEGIN SEQUENCE [WITH <bErrorBlock>] / RECOVER [USING <oErr>] /
        ALWAYS / END
- new debugger code with low level C interface borrowed from xHarbour

internals:
----------
- Preprocessor, compiler and macrocompiler code are fully MT safe.
- New lexer which translate preprocessor tokens to grammar parser
  terminal symbols - FLEX is not longer used by Harbour.
- Added prebuild grammar parser source code to CVS - BISON is no
  longer needed to build Harbour from source code - only developers
  which want to change Harbour grammar rules need BISON.
- Cleaned grammar rules with many small fixes
- Added PCODE version information to compiled files - it's checked at
  runtime by HVM to detect problems when files with old unsupported
  PCODE are linked with current HVM.
- Fixes in memvar core code (memory leaks, GPF, Clipper compatibility, etc.)
- Added POINTER items which inspected by GC.

- Profiler code disabled in default build.
GT:
---
- Added GTGUI.
- Added support for: REQUEST HB_GT_<name>_DEFAULT

RDD

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.46 Alpha Build 46 (2006-05-29) tag: build46

The compiler
=============================

  (FLEX version only).
- Added support for SWITCH command (see tests/switch.prg)
  (FLEX version only).
- Added support for FOR EACH loop (see tests/foreach.prg)
  (FLEX version only).
- Added new compiler switch -gc3 to generate real C code output
  (instead of PCODE array called by a C wrapper).
- Added new command line switch -r=<max_recursive_preprocessor_passes>
- Added -undef: compiler switch (borrowed from xHarbour).
- Added support for @filelst[.clp] - partially borrowed from xHarbour.
  It's not exactly the same as in Clipper because Clipper creates one
  final file when [x]Harbour series of files.
- Emit warning and error messages to stderr instead of stdout on *nix
  platforms.
- Added warnings in cases of duplicated loop variables.
- Fixed compilation of included files in cases when the file ends
  with ';' (with no LF or CR).
internals:
----------
- Fixed bug in divide by 0 substitution.
- Fixed bug in ASC() optimization (when character code > 127)
- Fixed path delimiters in included file names.
- Removed strong typing in the compiler. Reactivate it by compiling
  with -DHB_COMP_STRONG_TYPES.
- Fixed to release the memory if macro compiled code contains a
  variable or a function reference.
- Rewritten jump optimization.
- Added optimization for: IF .T.
                          IF .F.
                          WHILE .T.
                          WHILE .F.
- Added dead code eliminator. It works only when Jump Optimization is
  not disabled. As a result, we have smaller and faster PCODE.
- Do not strip redundant line information when compiled for debug (-b).
- Fixed many more memory leaks in the compiler. Now, the Harbour code
  compiles itself with no memory leaks.
- Added optimalization of '+=' '-=' '*=' '/=' operators using new
  PCODS: HB_[PLUS|MINUS|MULT|DIV]EQ
         HB_[PLUS|MINUS|MULT|DIV]EQPOP
- Added more optimization for localvar+=integer using
  HB_P_LOCALNEARADDINT pcode (borrowed from xHarbour).
- Enabled FM statistic by default when compiled without
  -DHB_FM_STATISTICS_OFF.
- Added new errors (memory corruption and memory overflow) for
  compiler level FM statistic.
- Fixed double value presented in verbose genc mode for
  HB_P_PUSHDOUBLE.
- Fixed stripping non identifier characters from symbol table name.
- Added escaping of '?' character in generated strings to avoid
  possible conflicts with trigraph sequences which are part of ANSI C
  standard.
- Force .0 at the end of double numbers to avoid possible range
  conflicts in generated .c files.
- Upper the default .prg function name created from .prg file name
  when compiled without -n switch.
- Fixed registering of startup procedure name.
- Changed code generated for double values to avoid limitation in some
  C compilers like MSC and possible differ conversion inside C RTL
  then the one which uses Harbour RTL.
preprocessor:
-------------
- Fixed to release memory allocated with the preprocessor.
- Fixed bug in processing the list of optional repeatable code.
- Fixed handling of optional clauses in command/translate.
- Fixed <-x-> match marker.
- Fixed compilation of \[ and \] in command/translate.
- Fixed to preserve spaces the same way (almost) as Clipper.
- Fixed translation of nested command/translate.
- Fixed translation of TEXT/ENDTEXT to be more Clipper compatible.
- Added new hidden preprocessor directive
  __text|ParseBlockCode|EndBlockCode|StartBlockCode
- Modified TEXT/ENDTEXT to use '#pragma __text'.
- Added #pragma __stream and #pragma __cstream (see doc/pragma.txt)

The runtime modules
=============================
API
---
- Separated internal and external API. Now the definitions for
  internal HVM structures and functions are excluded by default they
  could be enabled if user include hbvmopt.h before other header
  files. Such operation should be done ONLY by core code! If 3rd party
  developers use something like that then it's for their own risk and
  such code may stop to work with next Harbour versions. Without
  hbvmopt.h the internal structures like HB_ITEM, HB_DYNS, ... are
  mapped to 'void' so there is no way to access their members so we
  can modify them in the future without afford for 3-rd party code.
- Remove default API and stack macros. Now API/stack macros can be
  enabled by including hb_vmopt.h file. This file should be included
  ONLY by core code because binary object/libraries generated after
  can work only with EXACTLY the same HVM compiled the same C
  alignment switches. 3-rd party code should include hbvmpub.h only.
- Added support to passing function references as HB_IT_SYMBOL.
- hb_itemType() return "S" for HB_IT_SYMBOL.
- Message symbols are not function symbols, cleaned the HB_FS_MESSAGE
  usage and fix the problem with registering static function in global
  symbol table.
- Added HB_TYPE to as HB_ITEM type marker (UINT32 currently).
- Cleaned some ~HB_IT_BYREF which has no effect in current VM.
- Added new functions: hb_extIsObject(), hb_codeblockId(),
  hb_idleSleep(), hb_fsGetOsHandle(), hb_dynsymFindSymbol(),
  hb_dynsymGetSymbol(), hb_dynsymSymbol(), hb_dynsymName(),
  hb_dynsymMemvarHandle(), hb_dynsymAreaHandle(),
  hb_dynsymSetAreaHandle().
- Changed definition of HB_SYMB structure.
- Cleaned some HB_EXTERN_C declaration.
- Changed hb_arrayClone() declaration to:
  PHB_ITEM hb_arrayClone( PHB_ITEM pArray )
- Changed hb_arrayFromParams() declaration to:
  PHB_ITEM hb_arrayFromParams( int iLevel )
  The previous version needed a pointer to stack relocatable area so
  any stack resizing could cause GPF.
- Allow hb_param() to return parameters accessed by HB_IT_BYREF.
- Cleaned the code which created HB_ITEMs on C stack.
- Changed main VM loop to eliminate one comparision done on each loop.
  Now HB_P_ENDBLOCK and HB_P_ENDPROC pcodes set HB_ENDPROC_REQUESTED
  and the main loop can be exited only from one place. It gives some
  small but noticeable speed improvement.
- Possible problem fixed in __CLSADDMSG() where message parameter was
  required to be uppercase when overloading operators .NOT. .AND. .OR.
- Fixed GPF when unshareing string item buffer with embedded 0 by
  using hb_itemUnShare().
- Make HB_SET_TYPEAHEAD Clipper compatible.
- Set DOSERROR() to oError:OSCODE when RT error is generated.
- Fixed some small incompatibilities with Clipper in number to string
  conversions.
- Added HB_STR_DATE_BASE for conversion to string, Clipper
  compatibility though we are not 100% Clipper compatible in STOD()
  because we will have to reduce functionality (supported date range)
  to reach it. In Clipper STOD(DTOS()) is not revertible, it is
  revertible in [x]Harbour for the whole supported in string
  conversion range: 0000/01/01 : 9999/01/01.
- Fixed possible GPF in CTOD when badly formated date is given.
- Optimized hb_dateEncode().
- Fixed RT error number in hb_vmAddInt() for negative values to be
  Clipper compatible.
- Optimized __CLSADDMSG() to call hb_parc() only once instead of 25
  times for most cases.
- Synced file IO with xHarbour, it fixed some problems, added some
  missing functionality and long (64bit) file support for Windows.
- hb_DiskSpace() changed to not give a runtime error in case of any
  error, but set the FError() value instead.
- Added C -> OS file error translations - not perfect but better then
  the used hacks (borrowed from xHarbour).
- Use hb_fileNameConv() instead of hb_filecase(), hb_fileNameConv()
  is the only one function to make file name conversions dependent on
  some SETs.
- HB_MATHERRMODE() input validation logic moved to the lower level
  function. This is a step to make this a simple Set().
- Added STRPEEK and STRPOKE FS functions covered by HB_COMPAT_FLAGSHIP
  macro.
- Added hb_fsSetDevMode() Unix branch added.
- hb_secondsCPU() move inside FlagShip guard instead of HB_EXTENSION.
- Fixed invalid handle error in Windows when file() fails (borrowed
  from xHarbour).
- SetUnhandledExceptionFilter() is called if HB_INCLUDE_WINEXCHANDLER
  define is used.
- UnhandledExceptionFilter renamed as hb_UnhandledExceptionFilter, and
  WINBASEAPI removed.
- Added new functions HBDLLENTRY1() and HBDLLENTRY2(). These function
  allow to call a Harbour (self contained) DLL and provide it one or
  two Harbour items as parameters.
- Fixed GPF in HB_LIBDO called with wrong parameter.
- Fixed optimization of 'EVAL' in macro compiler.
GT:
---
- New GTAPI.
- Multi GT support with an option to link many GT drivers in a
  single binary and switch between GTs at application startup based
  on its environment.
- Added GTI_* defintions for hb_gtInfo() function. This function
  works in similar way to dbInfo() in RDD.
- New driver GTCRS based on xHarbour and Flagship curses code.
- New driver GTWVT for Win32 using GUI window instead of console.
- New driver GTXWC for XWindow Console.
- New driver GTALLEG for Allegro cross platform graphic libraries.
- Respect pure REQUEST HB_GT_NUL as user GT choice if only GTNUL
  is linked.
- Fixed displaying of boxes under the xterm, use @ TO instead of @ BOX.
Multilangual:
-------------
- Cleaned startup initialization code for lang and codepages.
  at least one lang module defined at startup.
- Codepage: Updated UNICODE values for characters in range 1-31 to
  keep DOS compatibility.
- Codepage: Renamed files (cdp*.c -> cd*.c).
- Codepage: Added UTF8 related functions: hb_cdpUTF8StringLength(),
  hb_cdpStringInUTF8Length(), hb_cdpUTF8ToStrn().
- Moved EN lang definitions to core lang code so we always have
- HU sorting order fixed to be more compatible with Clipper.
- Added BG language support.

RDD
=============================
- DBT, FPT, SMT memos are fully support and automatically detected in
  USE command. For newly created tables the memo type can be set with
  rddInfo(RDDI_MEMOTYPE,<DB_MEMO_DBT|DB_MEMO_FPT|DB_MEMO_SMT> [,<cRdd>])
  It's possible to use any combinations of memo and index files.
- Added RDDINFO() to set global RDD parameters. See dbinfo.ch for
  possible actions.
- Rewritten DBFNTX, now it supports in practice all CDX features with
  multi tags and many others. With RDDINFO() some important new
  features in DBFNTX can be enabled like increased maximum NTX file
  size up to 4TB, support structural/autoopen indexes, bounding record
  number with index key (like in CDX format what resaolves the
  performance problem with indexes which have a lot of non unique
  keys, etc.)
- User setable locking DBF mode.
- Added SIXCDX which is modified version of DBFCDX without trailing
  spaces compresion for SIX3 compatibility.
- Added ordKeyRelPos([nNewPos])->nOldPos which works with all RDDs
  and returns relative (from 0.0 to 1.0) position in index file but
  much faster then ordKeyPos()/ordKeyCount() combination. It works
  like AdsGetRelKeyPos()/AdsSetRelKeyPos() and the results for CDX are
  the same. For NTX ADS implementation is broken, just simply Extended
  System uses the same algorithm as for CDX what is wrong.
- Fixed ordKeyPos() for records out of scope.
- Implemented RDD level transforms (COPY TO/APPEND FROM).
- Long file support for all native RDDs. Now the maximum file size
  is reduced only by its structure if OS/file system supports 64bit
  file IO, f.e. for DBF it's 2^32 records. For memos it's:
  2^32 * MemoBlockSize, etc.
- Synhronize RDD code with xHarbour.
- New HSX RDD.
- New HBSIX RDD.
- Fixed possible GPF when "/an/existing/path/" was used as file name.
- Enable 'Y' (currency) fields, translated to HB_IT_DOUBLE.
- Fixed some wrong behavior in SORT parameters setting in __dbArrange()
- Removed hack with COPY TO when lastrec() == 1.
- Fixed GPF in DBF2TEXT when work are is not in use.
- __dbDelim() generate 2001 RT error when work area is not in USED()
  before export file is created.
- Added DBI_SCOPEDRELATION action. It alow to test if given relation
  on current work area sets scope on child index.
- Set Operation in error object to field name in field{put,get}
  methods.
- Added DBI_LOCKOFFSET.
- Added support for NULL value set in memo fields by ACCESS.
- Added all Clipper 5.3 BLOB*() functions support.
- Added new RDD DBFBLOB compatible with Clipper 5.3 DBFBLOB. It
  operates on memo files only (.dbv) without tables (.dbf).
- Do not report error when empty structure table is passed to
  DBCREATE().
- Added support for NIL value in SIX3 FPT files.
- Changed definition of SUPERTABLE for optional dynamic overloading.
- Added default SYSNAME method.
- Fixed possible memory leak when APPEND failed in TRANSREC method.

Contrib
=============================
- ADS: Added ADSCDX, ADSNTX and ADT RDDs. ADS RDD should not be longer
  used, it's only for backward compatibility.
- ADS: Call AdsFlushFileBuffers() only when _SET_HARDCOMMIT is set.
- ADS: Added possibility to save memo fields > 64K.
- ADS: Added support for relations in ADS* RDDs which are not
  supported directly by ADS or are for other non ADS* tables.
- ADS: Synced base RDD with xHarbour.
- Added conversion from tiny int MySQL type into numeric DBF.
- Added MYSQL_DECIMAL_TYPE for MySQL versions 5.0 and above.
- libct: Added CT3 like Window System, it's a GT driver which inherits
  from the existing one and adds CTW functionality.
- libct: Updated for GTAPI modifications.
- libnf: Use hb_fs*() API functions instead of calling DOS interrupts.
  Now NF dir functions works on all platforms.

  such procedures cannot be called from user code (Clipper compatible)
- Harbour now Run on 64 bits !
- Some small optimizations in harbour/source/vm/itemapi.c

The runtime modules
-------------------
- Enabled creation of classes from C level using functions:

- Cleaned all endian dependend code found - now Harbour can be compiled
  on LITLE and BIG endian machines - for some other like PDP ENDIAN it's
  enough to define proper macros in hbdefs.h
- Added macros for to get/put values in chosen byte order:
         HB_GET_LE_[U]INT{16,24,32,64}( pPtr )
         HB_GET_BE_[U]INT{16,24,32,64}( pPtr )

         HB_PUT_BE_[U]INT{16,24,32,64}( pPtr, nVal )
- Added macro HB_CAST_BYTE_NUMBERS_OFF which disables casting in
  HB_{GET|PUT}_{LE|BE}_* macros - it's necessary for some platforms like
  ALPHA DEC.
- Many macros added for easier manipulation of different APIs and platforms.
- Clean the code (no more warning messages under Linux and GCC and DOS

Version 0.44 Alpha Build 44 (2004-07-19) tag: build44

The compiler
------------
- Fixed support for late/early evaluation of macro exressions in a codeblock
  (Flex version). Harbour(flex) is now full Clipper compatible here.
- Fixed support for stringify match markers <""> and <()> in Flex version.
- New compiler flag -ks was added to enable support for
  strings as array of bytes. (Notice that support for strings
  as array of bytes is disabled by default both in the Harbour compiler
  and in harbour's runtime modules)
- Added a new compiler switch -kJ to disable jump optimalization and
  NOOP pcode removal (optimalization is enabled by default).
- When xbase mode is not used (-kc or -kch) then compiler doesn't
  generate the pcode for these xbase extended features.
- Added support for DO <proc> WITH @variable
- Fixed optimalization of literal strings that contain macro operator.
- Enabled support for break[].
- Fixed optimalization of far jumps (this fixes generation of pcode
  for abnormally large (DO CASE/IF/ELSEIF statements)
- Added support to OpenWatcom DOS/Win32.
- Fixed compilation of &(exp) in normal stringify
  markers (this fixes INDEX ON bug).
- Added missing support for @&macro and @M->memvar (aAdded a new
  pcode HB_MACROPUSHREF)
- Fixed generation of pcode for &(macro)->() syntax.
- Fixed #define parsing of pseudofunctions in cases where
  passed argument has the same name as declared parameter.
- Fixed parsing of nested #defines in command/translate
- Macro - Added HB_SM_ARRSTR support.
- Clipper preproceses '**' into '^' - harbour too
- Added HB_COUNTER and HB_PTRDIFF types - first for reference counters and
  second for any pointer differences and pointer to integer conversions.
- HB_EXPORT is added to ITEM API, FILE API and some other function
  definitions to make it possible to call them when they are in the dll.
- Removed all pointer/long castings (except runner.c).
- Fixed optimalization of AT,ASC,LEN,CHR functions
- Added posibility to specify the output PPO filename with -p flag
  e.g.  -pppo/myfile.ppo
- harbour.l modified to compile correctly with flex version 2.5.31.
- Fixed to compile FOR var[index]

The runtime modules
-------------------
- Enhanced Debugger.
- Added missing code to use HB_IT_POINTER just like other value's type.
  For example:
      p = GET_SOME_POINTER()
      ? VALTYPE(p)   //prints: 'P'
      ? p   //prints: 0x12345678
- The support for runtime definition of keycodes mapping was added
  (translation from terminal key sequences into INKEY() codes)
  eterm.map and linux.map are example files with keycode mapping
  HB_GT_KEYMAP() function was added (ncurses GT only)
- Added possibility to load a character mapping using HB_GT_CHARMAP()
  (ncurses GT only)
- Improved recognition of xterm compatible terminals (ncurses GT only)
- New internal command line arguments were added to control
  application at runtime:
        //FLAGS:switches
            this flag controls compatibility issues of the virtual
            machine
            Available switches:
            c - Clipper compatibility
            h - Harbour extensions (enabled by default)
            s - enable support for strings as array of bytes (disabled
                by default)
            For example:
            myapp //FLAGS:ch
            will disable support for strings as array of bytes

        //CANCEL:key
        //CANCELEX:keyex
            this flag allows change the keycode of application cancel
            request (usually Alt-C) - using normal INKEY() keycodes
            or extended keycodes (CANCELEX)
            For example:
            myapp //CANCEL:304
            will change Alt-c into Alt-b for cancelling (Alt-c is used
            to insert polish diactric letter)
- Fixed to release PUBLIC variables correctly
- Fixed bug in Directory( "c:\*.*" ) that returned 0 when hidden files
  were present.
- Alert() Fixed bug with messages longer then 60 bytes.

  undeclared variable is checked (Clipper creates the memvar variable).
- TGet - Fixed to correctly display buffer when negative value
  and '0' was pressed in the position next to decimal point.
- TGet - Fixed support for '9999.' picture.

  Dumps symbol name just before it's called. This is very useful when
  debugging GPFs as it will trace all PRG-level calls up until the crash.
  Uses HB_TRACE so traces are in line with any C-level traces
- Martin and Walter added a bunch of functions to libct
- David added the Path stuff so file() and other functions can work right
- Platform support for FreeBSD 4.4, which requires installation
  of the gmake (GNU make) port (instead of using FreeBSD's make)
