HOW TO BUILD HARBOUR FROM THE SOURCE
------------------------------------

You'll need these:
  - Flex
  - Bison 1.28 or upper (set BISON_SIMPLE envvar to point to bison.simple)
  - A supported (check make_gnu.bat for a list) C compiler
    (with all the envvars set (PATH, LIB, INCLUDE, etc...))
  - GNU-make if you want to use it with some other C compiler than GCC
    (as GCC already comes with GNU-make)
  - Harbour source
  - Around 10-15MB of free disk space for each separate platform/compiler
    combinations.

To build Harbour using GNU-make:
  - Set the required two envvars (check MAKE_GNU.* for them)
  - Run make_gnu.*
To build Harbour using non-GNU make with BCC 4.x, 5.x:
  - make_b32.bat
To build Harbour using non-GNU make with MSVC:
  - make_vc.bat

To build a final executable, see above, but use bin/bld*.* 
instead of make*.*
