HOW TO BUILD HARBOUR FROM THE SOURCE
------------------------------------

You'll need these:
  - Flex
  - Bison (set BISON_SIMPLE envvar to point to bison.simple)
  - A supported (check MAKE_TPL.BAT for a list) C compiler (with all the envvars set (path, lib, include, etc...))
  - GNU-make if you want to use it with some other C compiler than GCC
  - TASM for BCC
  - TASM32 for BCC32
  - MASM for MSVC
  - Harbour source
  - Around 10-15MB of free disk space for each separate platform/compiler
    combinations.

To build Harbour using GNU-make:
  - Set the required two envvars (check MAKE_GNU.* for them)
  - Run MAKE_GNU.*
To build Harbour using non-GNU make with BCC 3.1:
  - Run MAKE_B16.BAT
To build Harbour using non-GNU make with BCC 4.x, 5.x:
  - MAKE_B32.BAT
To build Harbour using non-GNU make with MSVC:
  - MAKE_VC.BAT

To build a final executable, see above, but use BIN/BLD*.* 
instead of MAKE*.*
