HOW TO USE THE CVS
------------------

Here's how to prepare for uploading to the CVS server
=====================================================

 1) Read the Harbour FAQ (www.harbour-project.org), monitor the 
    mailing-list (Harbour at www.onelist.com), consult with the
    developers, make contributions. This way your chances are high
    to get a RW access to the CVS.
 2) Before uploading anything you'll need Developer (RW) status for the 
    Harbour CVS server. To get this please make a request on the list, 
    or contact the Harbour Administrators. Note that getting Developer 
    status is not an automatic process.
 3) You'll need a CVS client for your platform.
 4) You'll need an SSH client for your platform.
 5) You'll need to configure CVS and SSH for the Harbour Project.
    (see: CVS_SSH.TXT)
 6) Do a complete checkout to get the fresh source tree.

Here's how to upload your changes to the CVS server
===================================================

 1) Do the changes in the source, and in parallel modify ChangeLog
 2) Go online (if needed)
 3) CVS LOGIN (if needed)
 4) CVS UPDATE
 5) Resolve all conflicts (mostly ChangeLog)
 6) Copy the last ChangeLog entry to the clipboard
 7) CVS COMMIT (starts another task on my system)
 8) New email message, paste the new ChangeLog entry
 9) Copy and paste the ChangeLog entry header to the subject after 
    "CHANGELOG: "
10) The CVS pops up a window with the changed filenames
11) Check if all the changed filenames are referred in the ChangeLog entry,
    if not, make the corrections and start again
12) Paste the ChangeLog entry header to the CVS window, save, exit
13) CVS is now uploading,
    if there are any errors, make the corrections and start again
14) Always check if the upload session ended without errors.
15) Send the email message containing the changes
16) Go offline (if needed)

Important notes:

 1) *Always* add a ChangeLog entry when uploading to the CVS.
 2) When adding a new file to the CVS, always use lower case 8.3 
    filenames (*), add a CVS ID header to the file, don't use tabs 
    in the file, end the file with a newline char.
    Possibly consult other Developers about the new filename and file
    placement.
    Add the new filename to the related makefiles.
    (*) There are two exceptions: ChangeLog.* and Makefile
 3) When adding a new directory, always consult the Developers about 
    the name and placing of it. On the CVS, there's no way to completely 
    remove a directory, that's why this is important.

Here's how to format your ChangeLog entries
===========================================

- Always add new entries to the top of the ChangeLog file.

- Add an entry header using this format:
  YYYYMMDD HH:MM GMT-+TZ Your Full Name <your_email_address>

- Add a entry body which lists all filenames changed, all of
  them with full path spec. Mention the name of the changed function or
  macro. Describe what you've changed, the reasons, and other comments 
  and explanations you find useful. If the change needs some related work
  to be done by someone else (documentation, makefile), make note about this.
  Group the related changes into logical sections separated by empty lines.
  
  Sample:

   * dir/filenam1.txt
   + dir/filenam2.txt
   - dir/filenam3.txt
     * Changed, bla-bla
     ! Fixed
     % Optimized
     + Added
     - Removed
     ; Comment

  Note that using these specific marks is preferred although not a 
  requirement.

- Leave an empty line between the header and body and one after the body.
