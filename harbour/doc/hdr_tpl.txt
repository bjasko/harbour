   V 1.4    David G. Holm               Removed "(C)" from Copyright notice
                                        Put author's name rather than date
                                        next to each version number, because
                                        the RCS tracks dates, but only tracks
                                        CVS user names, not author names.
   V 1.3    Victor Sezl                 Description line changed to be a
                                        template, too.
   V 1.2    David G. Holm               Added HRL/HVM license exception for
                                        executables. Added GNU web site.
                                        Replaced "?" in copyright statement
                                        with "(list of individual authors)".
   V 1.1    Victor Sezl                 Added templates for file and function
                                        headers. Committed to CVS.
   V 1.0    Victor Sezl                 Initial version.

Example:

/*  $DOC$
 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *      IsLeapYr()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      Dates
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Test if a date falls in a leap year.
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      IsLeapYr( [<dDate>] ) --> lIsLeap
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <dDate> is an optional date. If not supplied is defaults to the
 *      value returned from date().
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      TRUE if <dDate> falls in a leap year, FALSE if not.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      IsLeapYr() can be used to check if a given year is a leap year.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      // Check if it's a leap year.
 *
 *      If IsLeapYr()
 *         ? "One extra day before you get paid this Feb!!"
 *      Else
 *         ? "A normal year"
 *      EndIf
 *  $TESTS$
 *      valtype( IsLeapYr( date() ) ) == "L"
 *      valtype( IsLeapYr( ctod( "" ) ) ) == "L"
 *      valtype( IsLeapYr() ) == "L"
 *      IsLeapYr( SToD( "20000101" ) )
 *      !IsLeapYr( SToD( "19000101" ) )
 *      IsLeapYr( SToD( "19841231" ) )
 *      !IsLeapYr()
 *  $STATUS$
 *      C
 *  $COMPLIANCE$
 *      IsLeapYr() works exactly like CA-Clipper's IsLeapYr(), if your
 *      CA-Clipper doesn't have such a function you're probably in a
 *      different universe from the author of this function.
