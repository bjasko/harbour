FUNCTION HEADER EXAMPLE

 *      IsLeapYr()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      Dates
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Test if a date falls in a leap year.
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      IsLeapYr( [<dDate>] ) --> lIsLeap
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <dDate> is an optional date. If not supplied is defaults to the
 *      value returned from date().
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      TRUE if <dDate> falls in a leap year, FALSE if not.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      IsLeapYr() can be used to check if a given year is a leap year.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      // Check if it's a leap year.
 *
 *      If IsLeapYr()
 *         ? "One extra day before you get paid this Feb!!"
 *      Else
 *         ? "A normal year"

 *      !IsLeapYr()
 *  $STATUS$
 *      C
 *  $COMPLIANCE$
 *      IsLeapYr() works exactly like CA-Clipper's IsLeapYr(), if your
 *      CA-Clipper doesn't have such a function you're probably in a
 *      different universe from the author of this function.

/*
 * ChangeLog:
 *
 * V 1.9    Victor Szel                 Small format changes.
 * V 1.8    Victor Szel                 licence -> license
 * V 1.7    Victor Szel                 History separated from the file header
 *                                      template. Slight changes in the format
 *                                      of the header. Removed "(proposal)"
 *                                      from the top of the file. Added partial
 *                                      copyright header template.
 * V 1.6    Victor Szel                 RCS Id section separated from
 *                                      Licenc text.
 * V 1.5    Victor Szel                 Small name correction.
 * V 1.4    David G. Holm               Removed "(C)" from Copyright notice
 *                                      Put author's name rather than date
 *                                      next to each version number, because
 *                                      the RCS tracks dates, but only tracks
 *                                      CVS user names, not author names.
 * V 1.3    Victor Szel                 Description line changed to be a
 *                                      template, too.
 * V 1.2    David G. Holm               Added HRL/HVM license exception for
 *                                      executables. Added GNU web site.
 *                                      Replaced "?" in copyright statement
 *                                      with "(list of individual authors)".
 * V 1.1    Victor Szel                 Added templates for file and function
 *                                      headers. Committed to CVS.
 * V 1.0    Victor Szel                 Initial version.
