INTRODUCTION
============

This file explains how to enable tracing in Harbour.


TRACING
=======

You can enable tracing in Harbour by setting the following environment
variable to any number greater than zero and then recompiling Harbour:

  HB_TRACE_LEVEL

The value is of no importance right now, just the fact that the
variable is defined to a value greater than zero is taken into
account.  In the future, it may be possible to enable different
tracing levels by setting the variable to different values.

When Harbour is compiled with the variable is set as described above,
and then used to compile a regular Harbour application, the app will
output LOTS of tracing information to stderr.  If you are using a
sensible command shell (such as bash) you can redirect stderr to a
file like this:

  my_app 2>trace.txt


TRACING THE PREPROCESSOR AND COMPILER
=====================================

Usually, you will not want tracing enabled in the preprocessor and
compiler; otherwise, you will see the trace output while compiling
Harbour itself.  If you REALLY want to enable tracing in the
preprocessor and/or compiler, you must define, in addition to
HB_TRACE_LEVEL as described above, the following variable, and then
recompile the preprocessor/compiler:

  HB_TRACE_UTILS

The value is of no importance.
