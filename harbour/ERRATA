The following items are currently outstanding bugs or design issues that
require attention in the near future. This file differs from TODO in that it
shows current issues, not future design goals. Before reporting problems
with Harbour be sure to check here in Harbour's bug reporting system
<URL:http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?group_id=681&atid=100681>
and in TODO.

Note that, in terms of tidying up for a release, items in the bug reporting
system should be seen as additional items in this file.

Developers, take the following template and add to the list below, be as
verbose as possible in the description.

Current known problems and wishes:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platform...........: GNU/Linux with "later" GCC/GLIBC combinations.
Noted as of release: 0.37
Noted by...........: Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>
Severity...........: Annoyance
Bug/Wish/TODO/etc..: Design issue.
Description........: 

In GNU/Linux environments with "later" GCC/GLIBC combinations, when a user
finally links their Harbour compiled application, they see the following
advisory message:

/usr/local/lib/harbour//librtl.a(fstemp.o): In function `hb_fsTempName':
/usr/local/src/harbour/source/rtl/linux/gcc/../../fstemp.c:73: the use of `tmpnam' is dangerous, better use `mkstemp'

As the advisory states, the problem is that use of tmpnam is considered
"dangerous" (presumably a security issue more than anything) and Harbour's
fstemp uses tmpnam.

Note that the executable is still built and runs fine, the message is simply
an advisory from the linker. It is worth eradicating as it seems that some
people think that the executable has failed to build. It's also worth
eradicating because the warning is probably there for a good reason.
