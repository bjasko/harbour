/* $DOC$
*  $FUNCNAME$
*     FT_LASTKEY()
*  $CATEGORY$
*     Keyboard/Mouse
*  $ONELINER$
*     Force LastKey() to return a programmer-defined value.
*  $SYNTAX$
*     FT_LastKey( <nKey> ) -> NIL
*  $ARGUMENTS$
*     <nKey> is the Inkey() value of the desired key.
*  $RETURNS$
*     NIL
*  $DESCRIPTION$
*     It is occasionally useful to force LastKey() to return a known value.
*     This is easily accomplishing by using the KEYBOARD command, but this
*     has undesireable side effects (the keyboard buffer is cleared, and
*     the keystroke is processed whether you needed it to be or not).  This
*     function accomplishes the same task but without the side effects.  It
*     does so by directly modifying the memory location where Clipper stores
*     the LastKey() value.
*
*     Some highly unorthodox programming techniques, not to mention rather
*     strange use of Clipper internals, was necessary to make this function
*     work.  If this makes you uncomfortable, then don't use this function,
*     you worthless crybaby.
*  $EXAMPLES$
*     keyboard chr( K_ESC )
*
*     ? lastkey()  // returns 27
*
*     FT_LastKey( K_F1 )
*
*     ? lastkey()  // now returns 28
*  $END$
