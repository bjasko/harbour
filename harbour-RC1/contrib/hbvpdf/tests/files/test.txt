THE HARBOUR PROJECT CONTRIB LICENSE
===================================

There is no one single license that applies to the Harbour Project
contrib files. Some files use the Harbour Project Compiler license.
Some files use the Harbour Project Library license. Some files use
the old Harbour Project Library license. Some files may even use other
types of free software or open source  software licenses. Some files
have been donated to the public domain. If you use any of the contrib
files, you need to investigate the license that applies to each file.
