ODBCDEMO - ODBC Access Class Demonstration
Felipe G. Coury <fcoury@flexsys-ci.com>


This is the very first test of an ODBC class
that I am writing  for Harbour. To test  it,
simply  unzip the  contents  of this file to
any folder and run ODBCDEMO.EXE. Please note
that you'll need to have ODBC32 installed on
your machine.

The source  code  is  also  included,  named
ODBCDEMO.PRG, so  you  can  see  how  it was
written.

I would  like  to hear  your comments  about
this.  Just  drop me a  line at  my  private
e-mail.

Thanks

Felipe Coury
